"""The Codex CLI pin — the version a deploy installs, and the decision about
whether to install it. The Codex half of what `clipin` is for Claude.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL (2026-09-04). Nothing in this repo ever refreshed the
Codex pin: `update.sh` had no codex step, so `<data-root>/codex` sat at
whatever version a human last installed by hand — 28 August, on this machine. On 4 September that cost
hours. OpenAI's ``model/list`` gates rollout models on the REPORTING CLIENT
VERSION, so the stale pin returned 9 model ids while a newer CLI returned the
same 9 plus ``gpt-6-astra`` — same account, same auth, same code. The tier was
invisible, and the refusal said the ACCOUNT did not offer the model.

WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE, and why it imports nothing but `re`: both update
scripts read `PIN` out of here at a point in the deploy where nothing else
about the install is known to be healthy, exactly as they read `clipin.PIN` —

    python -c "import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'backend'); \
               from orgtree import codexpin; print(codexpin.PIN)"

— so it must import when the rest of the package cannot. No `providers`, no
`ledger`, no filesystem, no environment.

⚠ WHY A CODE-DECLARED FLOOR AND NOT ``@latest``. Installing whatever the
registry has newest on every deploy would fix the drift and create a worse
problem: two deploys of the SAME COMMIT would produce different agent
runtimes. This script's own Claude pin already argues the point — a caret
range means "the version a re-install lands on drifts with the registry — the
opposite of a pin" — and the Codex CLI is not a leaf dependency, it is the
process that RUNS every codex agent's turn. An unreviewed CLI arriving
automatically can change turn behaviour for reasons unrelated to the commit
being deployed, and this repo has already shipped fixes for codex app-server
sandbox mode, stream ordering and MCP approval. So: a deploy enforces a FLOOR
that a human chose and review saw, and every install converges on it through
an ordinary `git pull` — which is the actual defect, since the old scheme
converged on nothing at all. What a deploy must never do is silently adopt a
runtime nobody has looked at.

⚠ AND IT IS A FLOOR, NOT AN EQUALITY. A pin NEWER than `PIN` is left exactly
where it is and merely reported. An operator who installed something ahead of
us did so on purpose, and a deploy that silently rolls a machine backwards is
worse than one that says nothing. Same rule as the Claude pin.
