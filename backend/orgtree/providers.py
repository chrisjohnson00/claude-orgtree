# pyright: strict
"""The provider registry: which model PROVIDERS this install knows, and the
tier table each one brings (FR-15 / design-multi-provider.md, Phase-1 preview).

A "provider" is the vendor axis the user never had to name while there was
only one: Claude tiers (fable/opus/sonnet/haiku) come from Anthropic via the
Claude Code CLI; the codex tiers (gpt-reserve/sol/terra/luna) come from OpenAI
via the Codex CLI. Tier names stay ONE flat vocabulary — a tier implies its
provider, so nothing anywhere takes a provider argument next to a tier.

⚠ SCOPE: this module owns the provider AXIS — which tier belongs to whom,
detection, pricing views. ledger.TIERS / ledger.MODELS are the budget-bearing
tables and (since M4 hire enablement) carry the codex rows too; this module
DERIVES its views from them so seat prices exist in exactly one place. The
turn adapter is codexrun.py + the supervisor's dispatch leg; the
connected-provider hire gate is api.py's. `hire_enabled` below flips only
when the full MVP path (M1–M8) stands. Detection here is read-only: nothing
in this module spawns a codex turn or touches credentials beyond an existence
check of auth.json.

Codex CLI resolution mirrors the Claude pin (supervisor.CLAUDE): the env
override wins, then a private npm pin under the data root, then PATH:

    ORGTREE_CODEX > <data>/codex/node_modules/@openai/codex-<platform>/
                    vendor/<triple>/bin/codex[.exe]  (npm install --prefix
                    <data>/codex @openai/codex)      > PATH `codex`

The native platform binary is preferred over the `.bin/codex` npm shim for
the same reason supervisor.py avoids `cmd /c` shims: a .CMD truncates argv at
an embedded newline. Probing `--version` would survive that; a future turn
argv would not, so the resolver learns the safe habit now.

# `tools/install-autostart.ps1` contain no `codex` step — the pin is a manual
# `npm install --prefix <data>/codex @openai/codex` from the setup guide, so it
# is frozen at whenever someone last ran that by hand.
#
# That drift is not cosmetic. OpenAI's `model/list` gates rollout models on the
# REPORTING CLIENT VERSION, measured on this host 2026-09-04: the pinned CLI
# 0.150.1 (installed Aug 28) returned 9 model ids and the newer 0.153.0 on PATH
# returned the same 9 PLUS `gpt-6-astra` — same account, same auth, same code.
# So a stale pin makes a live tier invisible, and the failure presents as "your
# account does not have it", which is a lie about the wrong subsystem.
#
# This does NOT auto-upgrade. Swapping the CLI underneath running agents is its
# own hazard; the job here is to make the drift VISIBLE and let a person act.

#: How old the CLI's own update check may be before it stops being evidence.
#: The CLI rewrites `version.json` during ordinary use (observed minutes old on
#: this host), so a week means "this CLI has not run in a week" — at which
#: point "no update available" is not a finding, it is silence. Generous on
#: purpose: a check a normally-used install can trip is worse than no check.

#: the one tier whose availability is a live SERVER GRANT rather than a fact

# ⚠ THERE IS NO CAPACITY GATE ON HIRING, AND THAT IS A RULING, NOT AN OVERSIGHT.
# 65273fa added one: a Codex account with its usage window spent refused every
# hire, on the reasoning that the seat is taken before the agent's first turn
# comes back `usage_limit_exceeded`. The user reversed it the same evening —
# "i should still be able to hire agents if my usage window is up; i would like
# the ability to prepare an agent with a charter, even if i cant run it
# actively".
#
# That is the better model of what a hire IS. Hiring names an agent, writes its
# charter and fixes its scope; none of that spends a token, and a window that
# resets on a schedule is a reason to prepare work, not to be locked out of
# preparing it. The capacity question belongs to the TURN, where the Codex CLI
# already answers it loudly and where refusing costs nothing but that turn.
#
# So do not re-add `codex_capacity` here or in `provider_hire_gate`.
# `test_provider_hire_availability` §7 and `test_gpt_reserve_detection` §5 pin
# the ruling from both doors.


def reserve_availability(
        status: dict[str, Any] | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Is `gpt-reserve` hireable right now — the tier's OWN rule.

    THE REPORT (user, 2026-09-02): "i had access to gpt-reserve in my codex
    limit earlier today and could use it via the codex cli. however i no
    longer have access. yet the reserve token still appears."

    d7b98c7 answered that with the login KIND (a ChatGPT subscription, not an
    API key).  Necessary, and nowhere near sufficient: the login did not
    change across the user's outage.  What changed was the grant.  Measured on
    that machine the same evening — a gpt-reserve session at 16:06Z billed to
    its own weekly window (2%, resetting Sep 9) while the account's plan
    window sat spent (100%, resetting Sep 7); by 19:15Z reserve turns reported
    a `premium` limit with no windows at all, zero credits, and failed
    `usage_limit_exceeded` on the first message.  Reserve is a pool OpenAI
    hands out and takes back, and DETECTION HAS TO ASK SOMETHING THAT MOVES.

    ⚠ THE MODEL REGISTRY IS NOT THAT SIGNAL, and the second bug in this saga
    was believing it was.  An earlier pass read `visibility` out of the CLI's
    `models_cache.json` and refused on `"hide"`.  The user then got the grant
    back and the token STAYED hidden.  Measured 2026-09-03T00:03:43Z, from a
    registry file written seconds earlier: `gpt-reserve` was `visibility:
    "hide"` while the very same account held a live 8%-used reserve window and
    could use the model from the CLI.  `hide` means "not offered in the model
    PICKER" — `codex-auto-review` carries it too, permanently — and gpt-reserve
    is a routed pool, never picked, so it is ALWAYS hidden.  That check could
    only ever hide the tier forever.  It was inferred from a single observation
    of the withdrawn state, never compared against a granted one.

    Two questions:

      1. is the login one that can EVER hold reserve capacity (d7b98c7), and
      2. does the account hold a gpt-reserve RATE-LIMIT WINDOW right now
         (`codex_limits.grants`) — a granted pool gets a bucket of its own on
         the app-server's board, named after the model, and a withdrawn one
         simply has none.  That is the thing that actually moved across the
         user's outage, in both directions.

    There is no third question.  A spent usage window deliberately does NOT
    refuse a hire (see the ruling above `RESERVE_TIER`), so (2) asks whether
    the window EXISTS, never how full it is; reserve is prepared like any
    other tier and the TURN answers for capacity.

    Each may answer "unknown" (no CLI evidence, a stale board), and unknown
    NEVER refuses: the tier stays offered and the CLI fails the turn loudly,
    which is strictly better than a detection bug hiding a tier the user has —
    which is precisely the failure the registry check shipped.

    Assumes the family-level facts are already settled — Codex installed,
    signed in, the provider not turned off in App settings.  Both callers
    (`providers_payload` below, `api.provider_hire_gate`) check those first
    and then ask this, so there is one implementation of the reserve rule.

    Returns ``{"enabled": bool, "reason": str | None, "evidence": str}``,
    where `reason` is written to be read by the user as a tooltip and as a
    refusal message, and `evidence` names which of the three answered.
