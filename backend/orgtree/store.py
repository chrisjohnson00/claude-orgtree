# pyright: strict
"""Multi-org persistence (№36). One document per org under the DATA root — a JSON
file (`ORGTREE_STORE=json`, the historical format) or a SQLite database
(`ORGTREE_STORE=sqlite`, SQLITE-SPEC Phase 1, 2026-09-03).

Data root is ~/orgtree (NOT ~/.claude — spike finding 4, and node scratch dirs live
beside the ledger data).

⚠ SPIKE FINDING 4, RESTATED 2026-08-07 (six measurements against the pinned CLI, after
it misled a diagnosis): the file tools do not "refuse" a ~/.claude path — they raise a
PERMISSION REQUEST ("… which is a sensitive file"). An interactive seat can answer it;
a HEADLESS turn has no approver, so it surfaces as a refusal. The distinction matters
because the gate is not a classifier you can satisfy: an Edit(//path/**) allow rule, an
explicit --add-dir on the path, --permission-mode dontAsk, and a PreToolUse hook
returning permissionDecision=allow were each measured and each still refused. The gate
sits ABOVE the allow-rule, add-dir and hook layers. Only --permission-mode
bypassPermissions clears it, and that bypasses every other check too (user ruling
2026-08-07: agents that want to write the global skills run bypassPermissions; nothing
is plumbed over the file tools to fake it).

Layout:

    ~/orgtree/
      orgs/<slug>.json                the ledger documents      (ORGTREE_STORE=json)
      orgs/<slug>.db                  the ledger databases      (ORGTREE_STORE=sqlite)
      orgs/<slug>.json.premigration   the JSON doc as it was the moment it was
                                      migrated — NEVER deleted by code (§6.1/§6.4)
      scratch/<slug>/<node>/          node working dirs (flat per §7.6; made by the
                                      supervisor)

JSON writes are atomic (tmp + os.replace). SQLite writes are one transaction per
`save_org` (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` … `COMMIT`, WAL, `synchronous=FULL`).

THE SEAM (SQLITE-SPEC §4). `ledger.Org` is 8,000+ lines operating on `Org.d` as a
plain dict, so the whole storage change lives behind `load_org` / `save_org`:

  * `load_org` returns an `Org` whose `.d` is a `LazyDoc` — a real `dict` holding
    every small section and `nodes` eagerly; the heavy append-only logs
    (`mail_log`, `steered_log`, `turn_error_log`, `events`, `org_inbox`,
    `notice_log`, `user_mail_log`, `user_outbox`) are ABSENT until first touched
    and then materialise from their row tables. 75 % of reads never touch one.
  * `save_org` is compare-on-save: every small section and every node is
    re-serialised and written only if it differs from what was loaded. Loaded
    log rows keep their SQLite `seq` identity, so append/update/delete writes
    only the proven rows; an unprovable reorder or replacement falls back to
    replacing that owner/section. Dict logs are lazy per owner.
  * Nothing outside this module changed for it. `Org.d` still behaves as a dict
    (see `LazyDoc` for the four `dict`-subclass hazards and how they are met).

MIGRATION IS AN OPERATOR ACTION, NEVER AN INFERENCE (2026-09-03). Converting a
root's `<slug>.json` files to `<slug>.db` rewrites the data root, so no process
does it on its own authority. Under `ORGTREE_STORE=sqlite`:

  * `claim_data_root()` (the backend's first act) looks for unmigrated JSON
    BEFORE it touches anything. Found some and `ORGTREE_MIGRATE=1` is not in
    the environment → `MigrationRefused`, the process does not start, and the
    message says exactly why and what to set. Nothing is written — not even
    the `.owner` claim. This is the loudest thing in the file, deliberately:
    a quiet fallback here would look exactly like an empty org.
  * With `ORGTREE_MIGRATE=1` the migration runs after the claim and before the
    API binds (§6.2's ordering is kept; only the trigger changed).
  * A `.json` that appears LATER under a backend that already owns the root
    (a hand restore from a `.premigration` copy) is still migrated on demand —
    that process passed the gate at startup. A process that never claimed the
    root (a script, a test) gets the same refusal from `load_org`.

Why: the evening the default flipped, a test runner that strips `ORGTREE_*`
from its children ran a sqlite build against `~/orgtree` — the live root — and
`claim_data_root()` migrated production as a side effect. The verifier and the
`.premigration` files made it a five-minute rollback; the trigger was the bug.

# one release as the rollback target, §6.4.)
#
# Windows: `os.replace` over the live doc fails with WinError 5 while ANY
# handle on the destination is open — and MoveFileEx opens the target
# EXCLUSIVELY itself, so no share-mode trick on the reader's side helps
# (measured: a reader holding a FILE_SHARE_DELETE handle blocks the replace
# exactly as a plain `open()` does). The retry-with-backoff below was written
# believing this was a brief collision. It is not: with 8 reader threads
# looping on `open()`, `os.replace` succeeded 0 times in 1,659 attempts
# (0.00%), and at 4R/4W 18 of 8,467 (0.2%). The writer does not lose a race,
# it never gets to run — the 1.9 s backoff budget just delays the raise.
#
# So readers and the replace are made not to OVERLAP, by the cheapest thing
# that achieves it: readers take this latch SHARED for the microseconds of
# the byte read only (they never block each other, and they still never take
# DOC_LOCK — №22's read-outside-the-lock property is untouched), and
# `save_org` takes it EXCLUSIVE across the single `os.replace`. JSON parsing
# happens after the handle is closed and the latch is dropped, so a slow
# parse costs a writer nothing.
#
# ⚠ Nothing that can call back into load_org/save_org may run while this is
# held — the held regions are one `read()` and one `os.replace()`, keep them
# that way. It is per-process only, like DOC_LOCK; the retry loops stay as
# the residual defence against another process (a backup agent, an on-access
# virus scanner) holding the doc open.

# ------------------------------------------------- one backend per data root
# MEASURED, 2026-08-04 (test_compaction.py "xproc"): two OS processes running
# the canonical `with DOC_LOCK: load_org → mutate → save_org` cycle against one
# org doc lose **32–74 % of their completed writes**, with **zero exceptions,
# zero torn reads and zero orphaned temp files**. Both guards above are
# per-process: `DOC_LOCK` is a `threading.RLock` and `_IOLatch` a `Condition`,
# and `os.replace` is atomic — which is exactly why the failure is invisible.
# Every writer is told it succeeded; the loser's changes are simply not there.
#
# Note what this does NOT justify: a cross-process lock around `save_org`
# alone would not help at all. The race is the read-modify-write CYCLE, so a
# correct lock would have to span `load_org … save_org`, i.e. replace
# `DOC_LOCK` in every caller — regions that spawn CLI children and can be held
# for the length of a 600 s compaction fork. That is a deadlock surface, not a
# fix.
#
# So the rule the architecture already states — ONE BACKEND PER DATA ROOT — is
# enforced at the one moment it is cheap and safe to enforce: process start.
# The claim is an OS-level file lock, not a PID file with a staleness
# heuristic. That distinction is load-bearing: a stale-lock STEAL based on
# mtime is independently broken against a merely-slow (not dead) holder —
# reproduced 2026-08-04, four processes' critical sections overlapping by up
# to 2.0 s because `release()` deleted whatever file was at the path. A kernel
# lock has no stale state at all: when the holder dies, however it dies, the
# handle closes and the lock is gone.
#
# Wired at the top of `api.main()` (`store.claim_data_root()`), which refuses
# startup with a wall when another process holds the root. The mechanism is
# tested end to end in real subprocesses by `test_compaction.py` (section
# "xproc · the owner claim"). ⚠ Tests and drills that spawn their own backend
# must use an isolated ORGTREE_DATA — they already do, and now it is enforced.
#
# SQLITE-SPEC §5.1: the claim STAYS with the SQLite backend. The save became
# atomic; the load→mutate→save cycle did not, and `.owner` also guards
# `accounts.json`, `extern-peers.json`, `journals/` and the process table.

    log sections are ABSENT from the underlying storage until first touched
    and then load from their row tables (`__missing__`).

    Everything `dict` will not route through `__missing__` is overridden:

      get          `.get()` never calls `__missing__` — the #1 way to read
                   None for a 4 MB section

                   section exists in the database — a fresh org has none,
                   exactly as its JSON would not)
      setdefault   the dominant ledger idiom
      pop / del    `d.pop("account_token_uuid", None)`; a popped lazy section

      update / |=  `dict.update` writes straight into storage, bypassing
                   `__setitem__` — routed through it instead

    Verified hazards (§4.2): `json.dumps(d)` and `copy.deepcopy(d)` both go
    through `items()` and are safe. `{**d}` and `dict(d)` DO NOT — they read
    the storage directly and silently drop every unmaterialised section. The
    pre-flight grep for those over `backend/orgtree/` returned zero hits at
    `ec74e2f`; `materialize_all()` exists for any site that ever needs it.

    `list_orgs()` — which full-parses EVERY org document to read at most a few
    short strings. MEASURED 2026-09-03 on the live install: 80.3 ms per call,
    reading 18.7 MB (`orgtree.json` 11.2 MB + `resonite.json` 7.4 MB +
    `unity.json`), against a 233 ms floor for the whole endpoint. One of those
    parses was a straight duplicate: the handler had already parsed the org it
    was rendering, twenty lines earlier.

    So `loaded` is that document, passed back in. Its file is not re-read, and
    `_scan_orgs` skips it before the parse rather than after — filtering the
    row afterwards would already have paid for it.

    ⚠ ONE DEFINITION OF THE ROW. Both branches go through `_summary_row`, so
    the already-parsed org is filtered by exactly the rule the scanned ones
    are. Reading `net_identity` and `kiosk` directly here would be a second
    expression of it, and it would drift the moment either key moves.

    Portability note (agreed with `sqlite-review`, 2026-09-03): kept as its own
    small function rather than reshaping `_scan_orgs`'s contract, because under
    the SQLite backend this becomes a `doc`-row read per org with no node load
    at all — cheaper again, and a local change there rather than a merge.

    That note is now cashed in: the sqlite branch below reads ONE `doc` row
    per database and loads no nodes and no logs, where `_scan_orgs` would
    read every node row of every org to build a row this function throws all
    but two fields of away.
