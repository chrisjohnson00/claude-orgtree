"""PostToolUse steering hook — mid-task delivery without interrupting.

Runs after EVERY tool call of every agent (CLI >= ~2.1.2xx; older CLIs never
fire tool hooks headless). Asks the backend for steering messages pending for
THIS node and, if any, injects them as additionalContext — the model sees them
immediately after the current tool call finishes.

⚠ Hook processes get a SANITIZED env (custom vars do not survive), so identity
comes from the CWD (hooks run in the node's scratch dir:
<data-root>/scratch/<org>/<node>) and the port from <data-root>/.port, written
by the backend at startup. Must be fast and silent when there is nothing to
say.

    mail. argv names the exact node the backend launched.
