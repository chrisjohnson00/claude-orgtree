"""ONE deterministic agent-text renderer per leaf — `render_agent(ev)` (design I1).

Every function here reproduces, byte for byte, the text the corresponding producer
writes at ROLLBACK_BASE (the `[DOCKET ASSIGNMENT · …]` headers, the engine bodies, the
org-change notices). The producers migrate to `mint(...)` + `render_agent(...)` one
family at a time (design §9 step 3) and B4 asserts parity against fixtures captured
from the previous release. Where a producer composes free lines from state this module
cannot see (a batch's scope decisions, a crash report summary), the leaf carries those
lines as data and the renderer joins them exactly as the producer did.

The renderer is called ONCE, at mint, and the row body is frozen thereafter; nothing
ever re-renders a stored row (design I1, Opus O3).
