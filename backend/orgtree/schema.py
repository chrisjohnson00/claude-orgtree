"""The org document's shape, in one place (typing wave, docs/typing-plan.md).

One org = one storage document (stored as a SQLite database under
`orgs/<slug>.db`, or historically as a JSON file under `orgs/<slug>.json`;
store.py). Every dict that document contains is declared here as a TypedDict, so
pyright can catch key typos and shape drift — the class of bug the
misleading-reads history is made of. Nothing here exists at runtime beyond the
type objects: importing this module changes no behavior.

Ground rules:
- These types describe what the CODE writes today (Build sources: ledger.py,
  supervisor.py, api.py). Where old docs on disk may lack a key, the reader
  already tolerates it (`.get`) — model that as NotRequired, not as a lie that
  the key is always there.
- Extend this file rather than re-deriving a dict shape in a docstring. If a
  shape is genuinely open (freeform op payloads), say `dict[str, Any]` at the
  use site — never guess a narrower type than the code proves.
- Runtime-inert: `TypedDict` instances are plain dicts; there is no validation
  and none is wanted (store.py loads whatever document is on disk).
