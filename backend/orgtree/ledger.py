"""The credit ledger: nodes, the budget invariant, and the seven operations.

Semantics ratified in PLAN.md (all §-references point there):

    free(N) = grant(N) - SUM over live children C of ( seat_cost(C) + grant(C) )   >= 0

The user IS the org root (§7.4): there is no root node. Top-level nodes have parent None,
and the reserved actor id "user" has infinite free and unconditional authority.

Credits are occupancy, not spend (§3.4). A credit is not a dollar.

Stranding (§4.4, corrected during implementation): a warning fires whenever an operation
REDUCES a node's free across an archived dependent's rehire cost. Promote/demote leave every
free unchanged (the release and acquire paths cancel hop by hop), so moves cannot strand —
the ops that can are hire (the payer), forcible hire (the actor), rehire (the parent, for its
other archived children), reallocate(-Δ), and switch_model to a pricier tier (the chain).

Directory access (№30) is an inherited capability set, NOT a budget: a node may hold only
dirs its parent holds (top-level nodes are user-granted and unconstrained). Nothing conserves;
revoke is explicit; re-parenting intersects the moved subtree's dirs with the new chain.

# §3.1 — derived from published API pricing: a seat is the API $ per M INPUT
# tokens at the STANDING price. Promos never set seats — the sonnet-intro
# precedent, re-affirmed for sol by user ruling 2026-08-28 and for flash by
# user ruling 2026-09-02. Sonnet was 3, then 2 (user ruling 2026-08-12: $2/M
# locked in). The codex family (FR-15, same ruling): sol $5 standard (the
# current $4 is a promo through ≥2026-11-21), terra $2, and gpt-reserve/luna
# $0.20 → 0.2 each (they used to floor to 1; see the sub-$1 note below).
# The antigravity family (D-188, re-walked for the Antigravity CLI
# 2026-09-02): pro $2 standard (the ≤200K band — the >200K long-context
# surcharge is a cost-dollars concern, never a seat), flash $1.50 STANDING →
# floors to 1 (3.8-flash's $0.75 launch price is a promo through 2026-12-31,
# and a promo never sets a seat). Existing orgs migrate in the load hook
# below IF they still carry the old shipped default; a customised table
# keeps its own number. Tier names are ONE flat vocabulary — a tier implies
# its provider (providers.py owns that axis).
#
# ☞ SEATS ARE FRACTIONAL BELOW $1/M (user ruling 2026-09-03). The rule is
# `openrouter.seat_for`: floor(p) at or above $1, max(0.10, round(p, 2))
# below it. At or above $1 the old floor still governs, so flash stays 1 (not
# 1.5), pro 2, terra 2, sol 5, opus 5, fable 10, and haiku 1 (exactly $1/M
# lands on the ≥$1 branch, not the fractional one). BELOW $1 the seat is now
# the price: gpt-reserve and luna are $0.20/M and cost 0.2, which is the
# ranking information the old floor-to-1 destroyed — four Codex tiers that
# used to read 1·1·2·5 now read 0.2·0.2·2·5.
#
# ⚠ REPRICING A TIER IS A SEPARATE ACT FROM ADDING ONE, and it is the reason
# the second migration block below exists. The user's follow-on ruling
# (2026-09-03, verbatim: "i think if we are supporting fractional credts we
# should reprice agents that are under $1/m") moved gpt-reserve and luna
# AFTER the fractional machinery landed re-pricing nothing. A DROP is safe in
# the budget (`committed` falls, `free` rises, `free() >= 0` cannot start
# failing) but it is NOT safe unconditionally: `_check_tier_ceiling` compares
# seats as an ORDERING, so tiers that used to TIE at 1 no longer do — see the
# ⚠ in `_check_tier_ceiling`. A future RAISE would be the dangerous
# direction: it can overdraw a saved org, and nothing here handles that.
#
# ☞ THE SAME RULE REACHED THE DYNAMIC (OpenRouter) HALF ONLY ON 2026-09-04,
# a day late, and the delay is the lesson. The 2026-09-03 repricing block
# below names `gpt-reserve` and `luna` and so moved only them; every `or-*`
# favorite adopted before that day kept the old `max(1, floor(p))` snapshot,
# which is a FLAT 1 for every model under $1/M. The correction is general
# rather than a longer list of names — `openrouter.stale_seats` re-derives
# each `or-*` row from the price the document itself records — because the
# hard-coding is what caused the miss, not the particular names in it.
# ⚠ THE STALENESS WAS UPSTREAM OF THE DOCUMENT TOO: the seat is snapshotted
# into the favorites file by `add_favorite`, so a BRAND NEW org was being
# handed the stale 1 as well. That half is fixed at the source, in
# `openrouter.favorites`; this table's migration is only the document half.

        # one migration in this hook that must NOT stand as a rule. A
        # `switch_model` MELT still lands a seat difference in a grant, on
        # purpose, so the node's total holding does not move (opus 5 → or-free
        # 0.1 on a 0-grant node leaves grant 0.1 and holding 0.2). Rounding

        # standing rule every switch-and-reload cycle would add up to a credit
        # out of nowhere, which is exactly the slow mint a one-way rounding
        # rule produces. `Org.create` runs this same hook on an empty doc, so

        # this copy no later load re-announces, and unsaved copies die with
        # their load and re-derive identically — every reader sees exactly
        # one announcement. (Redteam-measured 2026-08-06: five unsaved
        # reads move nothing on disk; the first save persists exactly one
        # copy; later save cycles add nothing.)

        silently admitted everything it names. `_check_tier_ceiling` asked

        at switch_model and at plain rehire, while correctly refusing a

          · a STATIC tier keeps reading the module `TIERS`. Reading the
            document for it too would be tidier, but a document may carry an
            operator's OWN price for a static band (the authority suite has a
            fixture with `terra: 7`), and re-pricing the ceiling off that
            would change refusals for orgs that have nothing to do with
            OpenRouter. Out of scope, deliberately.
          · an `or-*` tier reads `self.d["tiers"]` — the SAME table
            `seat_cost` charges from, so the ordering and the bill agree by
            construction. There is nowhere else it could read: the module
            table has no row to offer.

        Both sides are seats on one credit scale, quantised to 0.01, so the
        comparison is well defined; `>` stays STRICT, so an `or-*` seat equal
        to the cap is admitted exactly as flash is admitted under a haiku cap.

        None means "not in the ordering", and the caller then refuses
        nothing — the same fail-open the module-table test had for an unknown
        tier. An `or-*` tier absent from the document cannot reach here from a

        The archive is 44.4% of the live document, so unlike `mail` and

        the note at the call site for both backends' numbers.

        ⚠ MARKER-KEYED, on the convention this file already uses for

        line. THE ONLY WAY anything should reach that mailbox.

        A NOTICE ARRIVES ALREADY READ (user, 2026-08-28). A notice is passive
        by construction — it lands to be read at leisure and never wakes
        anyone — so it never had business claiming unread status. Rather than
        teaching every unread count to skip notices, they simply never enter
        the unread set: `user_inbox` IS that set (the read endpoint's whole
        job is moving an entry out of it into `user_mail_log`), so a notice
        goes straight to the archive and is read on arrival by construction.

        ⚠ WHY AT THE SOURCE RATHER THAN IN THE COUNTS. Six places derive "how
        much is unread" — tree()'s `user_inbox_count` and `urgent_unread`, the
        tab title, `attentionPip`, the folder tab's badge and the mark-all-read
        button — and every one of them reads membership of this one list. A
        filter added to the counts would have to be added to all six and stay
        agreed forever; keeping notices out of the list fixes all six at once
        and leaves nothing to keep in step. (This is the same reasoning as the
        D-169 pip classifier, applied one layer further down: fix the fact,
        not each reader of it.)

        ⚠ THE PREDICATE IS `kind == "notice"` AND NOTHING ELSE. It is a
        first-class mail kind, minted only by orgtree_send_notice and by the
        ledger's own hand. It is deliberately NOT "came from @system": the
        ledger sends the user `decision` entries from @system too — a Fable
        limit exhausted, agents halted or dissolved — and those are exactly
        the mail a user must not have silently pre-read. Getting this
        predicate wrong HIDES REAL MAIL, which is far worse than the bug it
        fixes, so it stays narrow.

        ⚠ THE ID IS MINTED HERE, at the one door into this mailbox, and that
        is what lets `_backfill_mail_ids` be a one-time migration instead of a
        treadmill. AUDITED 2026-09-03: of fourteen call sites, FOUR passed an
        entry with no id — the two Fable-limit notices, the forwarded audience
        request, and the weekly-limit decision — so the id could not simply be
        assumed present, and the old per-load walk was genuinely still doing
        work rather than being vestigial.
        Fixing the four call sites would have left the fifth to whoever writes
        it next; fixing the door cannot be forgotten. Per-mail read tracking
        and retraction both key on this id, and under the SQLite store's
        compare-on-save an id-less entry is worse than cosmetic: `setdefault`
        mints a FRESH uuid on every construction, so the section differs from
        its snapshot every time and every load+save rewrites the whole 4.4 MB

        retire()'s own path unmodified (auto-dissolve on live reports); the
        new mutation is `parent.grant -= stake` afterwards, which nets the
        parent's headroom to exactly where it was before the hire ever
        happened — versus a plain retire's +stake. That freed-headroom
        recompute is what makes retired seats rehireable, and defeating it is

        USER-ONLY (ruling 2026-08-11, mirroring delete()): the claw-back
        lands on a THIRD party — the superior — which is no agent's to

        Arithmetic safety: while the child is live, committed(parent) ≥ stake

        where it started. The min() below extends totality to the
        already-archived case, where a reallocate may have moved the freed
        headroom since: the claw-back takes what is reclaimable and says so,
        and never pushes free(parent) negative.

        ⚠ Cascaded hires need no chain walk: _chain_acquire inflates the
        IMMEDIATE parent's own grant when a hire bubbles, so the parent's
        stored grant always fully reflects this child's stake. Residual

        its desk and orgtree_read_transcript read its session, and a turn

        SESSION, never the seat.

        Why it exists: /compact resumes the prior CLI session, reloading the
        full transcript as input — idle past the cache TTL that reload pays
        near-full input price. This resets the session instead: the seat
        keeps its id, parent, scope, charter, grant and TEAM; only
        `session_id` is replaced (fresh id ⇒ the next turn starts empty), so
        the successor pays only for the history it actively chooses to read
        (docs/cache-economics.md has the arithmetic).

        The pre-compact session archives IN PLACE as a knowledge bearer
        `nid@gen` — compact_split's exact lineage shape (0 credits, tools
        stripped, successor backlink, rehireable as the node's own

        Was. (shipped 2ca1a14, reworked before ever deployed to a live org):
        retire + fresh hire under a suffixed name (`nid-2`) — which broke
        addressing (every peer mailing the old name deferred into an
        archived mailbox) and orphaned teams (a live-reports refusal). The
        in-place shape has neither problem, so BOTH are gone: reports keep
        their superior, correspondents keep their address.

        The seat's open request batch is MOOTED: the successor session never

        (§4.6-generalized). Agents may switch models anywhere in their
        SUBTREE, but never their own (user spec); the user switches anyone.

        D-234 (user ruling 2026-09-03): a switch asked for while the node is
        MID-TURN is QUEUED, not applied — the model stays what the running
        turn launched with, `pending_switch` records the target, and the
        switch applies at the turn boundary (the supervisor's `_run_one_turn`
        finally block, the one place every exit passes through; `reconcile`
        for a turn the backend's death ended). Interrupting the turn is the
        documented way to make it immediate. `busy` is the supervisor's live
        answer (the API doors pass it); the seat's durable `inflight` marker
        is read regardless, so the ledger alone answers correctly for a turn
        persisted before its process spoke. A second request while one is
        queued REPLACES the target; asking for the CURRENT tier cancels it.
        `_queued` is the pending record when the boundary applies it: the

        team" is instead a batched pair of moves, see move_batch).

        Because the shape is untouched, no cycle is constructible and the
        depth/children caps hold by construction — for ANY pair, nested or
        disjoint. What follows from the relabeling:

        • the SEAT keeps what the chain clamps and funds — its reports
          (archived dependents included), its grant, its team charter, its
          display slot, and the four chain-clamped scope sets (dirs, tools,
          visibility, permission mode — №30 + D-021 + D-102). Every
          containment edge keeps its pre-swap ⊆ relation, so no bystander
          is ever swept;
        • the AGENT keeps what identifies it — charter, session, mailbox,
          watchdogs, external handles, lineage stack (which follows it,
          §8.5), and the personal scope keys that clamp against nothing
          (effort, auto_cheap_compact, model_version);
        • grants ride the seats, so a same-tier exchange is budget-neutral
          at EVERY node, and a cross-tier one surfaces exactly the
          seat-cost difference at the two boundary payers — pre-checked
          below, so a refusal mutates nothing (§2b atomicity). The grant
          VALUE seated at top level never changes, so D-014 cannot trip on
          this route;
        • a nested, non-adjacent pair keeps a standing audience (grantee =
          the descended, grantor = the risen), §7.3-anchored on the grantor
          so it lives exactly while the risen still commands the other.

        superior, and `target`, with its ENTIRE existing subtree, becomes
        `nid`'s report. Nobody else moves.

        The accounting is the whole point, so it is stated exactly. Write
        s(x) for seat cost and g(x) for grant, and let P be target's former
        superior. The mutation is

            g(target) -= s(nid) + g(nid)        # target hands back nid's stake
            g(nid)     = s(target) + g(target)  # …and nid now funds target

        report, paid out of target's own free at that moment (§4.6). Making
        the caller pay the ordinary price of an ordinary hire is what keeps
        this from being a way to spend a superior's credits without asking.

        Scope rides the SEAT (D-224's rule for the exchange, and forced
        here): `nid` takes target's dirs, tools, visibility and permission
        mode, because target's branch is about to sit beneath it and

        matching event. Free by ruling (never enters TIERS), bounded
        numerically. Kinds:
          file     poll a path; new content matching `pattern` fires (the
                   high-water diff also recovers events from orgtree's OWN
                   downtime — the FR-07-spool property, for files)
          command  run a command each interval; matching output fires
          process  liveness — `pid:N` or `port:N`; fires on the DOWN edge
          stream   a persistent LISTENING command: each matching stdout line
                   surfaces the moment it occurs (user ruling: the realtime
                   alternative to a cadence); dies with orgtree, re-armed by
                   the engine at startup — downtime output is honestly lost
        Capability rule (ruling): a dog runs with its OWNER's hands —
        command/stream require the owner to hold bash and run inside the
        owner's sandbox when sandboxed; file paths are containment-checked
        at the API boundary against the owner's readable roots.

        `notice=True` (user ruling 2026-08-21) makes the fire PASSIVE: the
        mail lands in the owner's box exactly as before, but no turn is
        STARTED for it — the same bargain orgtree_send_notice strikes, and
        it reuses that mechanism (`send_message(..., wake=False)`), so a
        RUNNING owner is still steered mid-task and only an IDLE one is left
        alone. Default stays waking: every dog armed before this existed,
        and every dog armed without the flag, drives a turn as it always
        has. The flag is for "tell me the build finished" — worth knowing,
        not worth a turn.

        `shell` (2026-08-22) opts a command/stream dog out of the platform's
        native shell. ABSENT — and every dog armed before this existed is
        absent — means native, i.e. `shell=True`: cmd.exe on a Windows host,
        exactly as before. "bash" runs `bash -lc` instead, for agents who
        want the POSIX idiom the old tool card wrongly implied they had.

        ⚠ The API boundary REFUSES "bash" when no bash can be found, rather
        than falling back (see api.py). Falling back would rebuild the defect
        this field exists to fix, one level up: the agent asks for bash, is
        given cmd, writes bash, and the dog matches nothing forever — this
        time with the tool having agreed that bash was fine.

        `once=True` (D-200, user request 2026-08-30) makes it a ONE-SHOT DOG:
        it fires exactly once and removes itself as part of that fire. Default
        OFF, stored only when set, so every dog armed before this existed and
        every dog armed without the flag is persistent exactly as before.

        WHY IT EXISTS, from the case that produced it: a watchdog whose
        readiness condition encodes a DEADLINE rather than an EDGE is
        permanently true once the deadline passes, so it re-fires every
        interval forever. `d181-population-bar` did precisely that — it woke
        its owner every 15 minutes with the same verdict until the owner
        noticed and removed it by hand. A one-shot dog is the fix for that
        whole class: any dog whose question has exactly one answer.

        ⚠ A one-shot dog is removed only by a FIRE. `watchdog_alert` — the
        subject-went-quiet self-report — deliberately does not spend it: an
        alert means "I can no longer answer the question you asked", and
        retiring the dog on that would throw away the watch precisely when it
        has not been answered yet."""

        TYPED PATH (design §3, family monitor): the engine passes the event
        `lines` (+ `prefix`) and THIS method mints `monitor.watchdog_fired` —
        the ledger is the one place that knows whether the dog is one-shot,
        so `once` on the event is true by construction and the rendered body
        (note included) is frozen on the row beside `ev`. The positional
        `body` path is the pre-typed shape: a caller-built body, no `ev`,
        the note appended by the same helper the renderer uses.

        ⚠ D-200 — WHY THERE IS NO "ORDER" TO GET WRONG HERE. A one-shot dog
        must not mail without removing itself (that is the runaway this fixes)
        and must not remove itself without mailing (that loses the event with
        no trace, which is worse). Both hazards come from treating the mail
        and the removal as two steps that could half-happen. They are not:
        the mailbox and the watchdog registry are two keys of ONE document,
        every caller of this method mutates that document under `DOC_LOCK` and
        persists it with a SINGLE `save_org`, and `save_org` writes
        atomically. So the two land together or neither lands. The sequence of
        the statements below is therefore irrelevant to correctness, and the
        thing that actually matters — that no caller can perform one without
        the other — is enforced by both living in this one method.

        The one failure that remains is the save itself failing, and it fails
        in the safe direction: neither the mail nor the removal is persisted,
        the dog is still armed on disk, and it fires again next interval. A
        duplicate fire is recoverable; a silently swallowed event is not."""

        a reading surface, not a download. A small card pops out beside the

        (the present parks like an ask but nothing voids it — a document is
        a standing artifact, not a pending question). `replaces` updates an
        earlier presentation in place instead of stacking a second card.

        HTML mockups (present-html-mockups-in-a-new-browser-tab, 2026-09-06):
        `html_file` names a snapshot the API layer already copied into the
        node's outbox/ (`outbox/mock.html`, the orgtree_send_file rule —
        containment, copy-not-reference, name dedupe all happen THERE; this
        method records, it does not touch disk). The record then carries
        `format: "html"`, `file` and `bytes` and an EMPTY body, so the
        markdown reader never renders HTML as markdown and the tree payload
        stays metadata-only. The bytes are served by the mockup wrapper route
        (api.document_mockup), never inline. `replaces` may switch a card
        between the two formats; the stale format keys are dropped so a
        record is never half of each.

        Gate (user ruling 2026-08-05, D-100): presentation needs a DIRECT
        user audience — top-level or a held user-audience grant. Unlike
        ask_user there is NO auto-bridge: everyone else is refused. A
        document card is a standing claim on the user's screen, so the
        chain of command applies to it harder than to a question, not
        softer. Headless orgs refuse for ask_user's reason (§9.6 ②): the

    # ================================================================ docket
    # Durable work items (docs/work-items.md, docket-final-spec.md). Nothing
    # here lives on a node: an item survives retirement, compaction and
    # reassignment. Two doc-blob lists, `work_items` (active) and
    # `work_items_archive`; an old document without them is an empty docket.
    #
    # THREE clocks, on purpose. `updated_at` moves on ANY mutation;
    # `docket_at` moves only on a DOCKET UPDATE — an agent's status update
    # (the two lists), creation, acceptance, reopen, supersede. The row age the
    # user sees and the one-hour auto-archive both run on `docket_at`, so a
    # question attachment, a delivery claim or a user dismissal never resets
    # the "last heard from" clock and never keeps a finished item young.
    #
    # `status_at` is the third, and it answers the question neither of the
    # others can: WHEN DID THIS ITEM LAST ACTUALLY CHANGE STATE? A progress
    # note, a retitle or an attention flag all advance `docket_at`, so an item
    # that genuinely went open → blocked sorts identically to one whose owner
    # merely added a line. It moves ONLY when the status VALUE changes —
    # creation, an update that names a different status, accept, reopen,
    # supersede — and creation is the initial status time, because an item has
    # had its status since it existed.
    #
    # ⚠ ITEMS THAT PREDATE THE FIELD DERIVE IT FROM RETAINED HISTORY, and fall
    # back to their creation time. What they must NEVER do is inherit a recent
    # timestamp from an unrelated edit: that would move an item nobody touched
    # to the top of "most recently changed state", which is a lie about the
    # data dressed as an ordering. See `_work_status_at`.
    #
    # Archive is DERIVED on read (`_work_archived`), not a stored boolean:
    # a stored flag is exactly the durable-flag-nothing-clears defect the
    # team charter names. The physical move is a sweep at the start of every
    # docket mutation. An item that holds attention (a pending attached
    # question or a manual flag) is never archived, even if the list already

        Three rules, one per situation, and they are not the same rule:
          · ENTERING a state in the map REQUIRES its field. That is the user's
            2026-09-05 requirement: blocked, waiting and dropped must each say
            something. For `dropped` it is the whole record of why the work
            ended, so it is the one thing the item cannot be closed without.
          · ALREADY in the state and the field not supplied: left alone. Items
            that predate this requirement stay editable rather than becoming
            un-updatable, which is why the check is on the transition and not
            on every update.
            ⚠ REACHABLE FOR blocked AND waiting ONLY, and nothing here
            changes that: this helper carries state information, it does not
            grant edit rights over a CLOSED item. A dropped item is closed, so
            the closed-item guard refuses a plain update before this runs. A
            legacy drop therefore stays READABLE and REOPENABLE but is not
            editable while it stays dropped — it cannot be given a reason
            after the fact, and a stored one cannot be corrected in place.
            Said here rather than left as a rule that reads as though it
            covered all three states.
          · A BLANK string supplied is REFUSED, never stored. Blanking used to
            erase the field silently; erasing required information without a
            word is exactly the failure the requirement exists to stop.

        an update that does not pass attention=true CLEARS a standing flag,
        because the latest update is the complete current statement.

        AN UPDATE CLAIMS THE ASSIGNMENT (user ruling 2026-09-05 21:02, via
        Astra 21:15). Assignment is ownership, and the agent writing the status
        is the agent doing the work — so an authorized update makes that agent
        the owner. BEING ALLOWED TO UPDATE IS THE CLAIM MECHANISM the user
        described, participants included; an actor that may not update is
        refused before any of this and claims nothing.

        ⚠ AUTHORIZATION IS READ FROM THE PRE-UPDATE STATE, and that ordering is
        the guard. Every owner-level check below (drop, reopen, retitle,
        re-scope) is answered against the authority the actor held when the
        call ARRIVED — otherwise a participant's claim would take effect
        mid-call and hand it, in the same breath, rights the first line of this
        method had already refused it.

        `owner` is the explicit target, and it WINS: a call that says where the
        item goes never first assigns it to its author and then moves it, so
        the history shows one assignment and the notification names one
        recipient.

        THE ADMINISTRATIVE UPDATE (Astra ruling 2026-09-05 21:18). A superior
        writing a status on somebody else's item — a docket sweep, a root
        summary, a correction — would otherwise take the item, because the
        claim is uniform on purpose and has no ancestor exception. It passes
        `owner=<the current owner>` and keeps it where it is: naming the target
        that is already there changes nothing at all, so there is no history
        row, no notification and no reassignment to undo afterwards."""

    #
    # Authority is deliberately narrower than `_work_can_manage`: deletion is
    # the one act the record cannot report afterwards, so it belongs to the
    # user, to a STRICT SUPERIOR of the item's anchor (owner, else creator), or
    # to the anchor itself only when it answers to nobody but the user (a
    # top-level agent such as the coordinator, whose own items have no
    # superior to ask). A subordinate never deletes its own ticket — its
    # superior does; participants and the named reviewer never do.
    #
    # What goes: the record itself, from the active list or the archive, and
    # every pointer another item holds to it (`dependencies` entries and a
    # `superseded_by` naming it), each recorded on THAT item's history. Its
    # NAME is retired (`work_deleted_names`, names only): a later item with
    # the same title mints `title-2`, so an old chip, closed ask or mail row
    # carrying the name can never resolve to a different ticket. What
    # refuses: children still nested under it (move or delete them first) and
    # an OPEN attached question (it belongs to its asker — withdraw or answer
    # it first). What stays: mail, notices and ask history that mention the
    # name — those are records of the past, and every reader of a docket
    # pointer already tolerates a name that resolves to nothing
    # (`_work_pointer_visible`). One `work_deleted` event on the org log is
    # the audit trail; it is not a docket row and lists nothing.
