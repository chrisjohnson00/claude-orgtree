"""The Codex turn runner over a reusable `codex app-server` JSON-RPC client.

FR-15 Phase 1 (design-multi-provider.md §3.2 + Appendix B/C, all measured on
codex-cli 0.150.1 against a live account). The shape deliberately mirrors the
Claude lane: one turn object at a time, resumed by a durable session id — here
the app-server `threadId`, harvested from `thread/start` and passed back
through `thread/resume` on the next turn. The process itself may come from the
warm pool and survive that boundary. Steering and interrupting act on the
LIVE client object the supervisor holds while the turn runs:

    turn/steer      — append input to the in-flight turn (expectedTurnId
                      guard; measured landing inside the same turn, C.2)
    turn/interrupt  — graceful stop; the turn completes with
                      status "interrupted" (C.3)

Org powers attach as **dynamicTools** (measured round-trip, M6 probe): the
thread is started with the orgtree tool cards as client-defined function
tools; the model's calls arrive as `item/tool/call` server-requests and the
supervisor answers them in-process — no bridge process, no writes to the
user's codex config, and per-agent identity is simply which dispatcher
answers. Approval callbacks (`item/commandExecution/requestApproval`,
`item/fileChange/requestApproval`, …) arrive the same way and are decided by
the caller-supplied policy hook — that is the ⚙-rights seam.

⚠ CREDENTIALS: this module never reads, copies or moves auth material. The
CLI process inherits CODEX_HOME (default: the machine's own ~/.codex, the
signed-in primary) and maintains its own auth.json in place. Copying that
file anywhere would split-brain the refresh cycle (design §3.4); nothing
here, and nothing built on top of this, may do it.

Hermetic by construction: everything is parameterized (exe, home, cwd,
hooks), so tests drive it against an impostor script instead of the real
CLI — see backend/tests/test_codexrun.py.

        the READER thread while this one is still inside `request()`'s poll

        `item/completed` are all observed BEFORE this method returns — on
        every run of a ten-run measurement, fresh threads and resumed ones
        alike. A caller that opens its journal on the return value therefore
        streams assistant output against a transcript that does not yet carry
        the user's message. test_codex_stream_order.py holds that failure
        down: remove this hook and it reports it.

        The hook is fail-open: journaling must never be the reason a turn
        does not run (same contract as `_codex_journal`), so an exception in
