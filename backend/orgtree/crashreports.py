"""Server-side crash-report intake for the frontend's crash reporter
(frontend/src/crashReporter.ts).

Two jobs, kept out of api.py's routing noise:

  - resolve_stack(): shells out to a small Node script that maps a minified
    production stack trace back to real source positions, using the HIDDEN
    source maps written beside the build. They are hidden (vite.config.js:
    build.sourcemap = 'hidden') and then physically moved by frontend/scripts/
    postbuild-sourcemaps.mjs to frontend/sourcemaps/ — a SIBLING of dist/, not
    a subdirectory of it. That distinction is load-bearing: api.py's SPA
    catch-all (`@app.get("/{path:path}")`) serves ANY file whose resolved path
    falls under FRONTEND_DIST (= frontend/dist), not just the /assets
    StaticFiles mount — a first version of this that used dist/sourcemaps/
    was measured serving the maps at GET /sourcemaps/<file>.map anyway.
    Landing them outside dist/ entirely is what actually keeps them off the
    public surface; resolving server-side, straight off that directory, keeps
    that privacy while still giving crash reports real file:line:col.

  - save_report()/list_reports(): durable, timestamped JSON files on disk,
    independent of any org or agent — a report must survive even a first-load
    crash, before any org has loaded successfully.
