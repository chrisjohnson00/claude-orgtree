"""D-201: the warm CLI process pool.

Orgtree historically started a brand-new CLI process for every single turn,
which made everything an interactive harness reads once at startup — the MCP
handshake, the system prompt, the working-directory scan — into something
re-read and re-sent per turn. Measured cost (cache-misses' audit, 2026-08-30):
agents cold on 44.3% of quiet turns vs 0.2% interactive, ~200k tokens re-sent
per cold resume.

This module keeps ONE parked CLI process per eligible live agent, spawned at
boot and on hire, and hands it to `_run_one_turn` when a turn arrives. It owns
both Claude's stream-json process and Codex's app-server process; Antigravity stays
excluded pending its unresolved persistent-session probe. The rules are the
user's, verbatim where it matters:

  · processes only end on RETIREMENT, an explicit SYSTEM-PROMPT CHANGE, or
    orgtree SHUTDOWN (the job-object leash covers shutdown). No idle reaping,
    no cap eviction, no tidiness. Anything else killing a parked process is a
    defect.
  · a prompt change respawns the process IMMEDIATELY, in the background —
    never "mark dirty and fix it when a turn comes". The one exception: an
    agent MID-TURN is never disturbed; its re-warm happens at turn end.
  · CLAUDE adds no explicit MCP-handshake barrier (user ruling 2026-08-30).
    The CLI's `alwaysLoad` setting can nevertheless hold a cold or too-young
    process's turn-1 prompt for its connection timeout; the production audit
    measured that wait and the retain/revert policy is still open.
  · CODEX prewarming is FULL (user-authorized change, 2026-09-01): a parked
    app-server completes its bounded idempotent `initialize()` handshake and
    obtains its MCP inventory/readiness (ready, or explicitly degraded)
    BEFORE the seat is marked warm — asynchronously, after parking, so the
    keeper never blocks and a racing first claim still reuses the exact PID
    exactly as before. Prewarm sends NO thread/start, NO thread/resume, NO
    developer instructions and NO turn/start; it is local process readiness,
    never a provider call, and provider cache/session evidence is untouched.
    A failed or timed-out initialize kills and reaps that generation
    (`prewarm-failed`) and the seat falls back to spawn-per-turn.

THE WARM PROCESS IS A CACHE, NEVER THE SOURCE OF TRUTH. Every caller falls
back to today's spawn-per-turn when the pool has nothing valid, and the agent
notices nothing. Correctness over speed: a process whose rendered identity
hash no longer matches is killed, not served — a stale system prompt would
mean a retool or grant silently not applying.

INVALIDATION IS A HASH, NOT AN EVENT LIST (coordinator ruling). We hash each
provider's exact process-scoped inputs: rendered identity, native startup
instructions where applicable, spawn argv (including launch-scoped MCP
configuration), credential identity and explicit environment. An enumerated
list of invalidating events is exactly what goes stale when someone adds a
surface; the audit found surfaces nobody had enumerated.

KILL SWITCH (cache-misses' A/B requirement): ORGTREE_WARM env sets the
default — which is ON (user ruling 2026-08-30). The file
<ORGTREE_DATA>/warm.flag overrides the env AT RUNTIME without a rebuild —
write "0"/"1", or JSON {"enabled": bool, "exclude": ["slug/nid"]} for
per-agent arms; the D-203 settings toggle writes the same file through
set_enabled(). Checked cheaply (mtime cache) on every decision.

TELEMETRY: append-only JSONL at <ORGTREE_DATA>/journals/warm.jsonl, in the
exact shape cache-misses registered (admit / proc / pool / cache-break lines).
Deliberately NOT in the org document (DOC_LOCK contention) and NOT in scratch
or transcripts (which would dirty the very prompts being measured).

    THIS TURN, threaded through by the caller — never re-read here. The flag
    can flip between the decision and this write, and an admit row labelled
    with an arm the turn was not served under is silent misattribution in
    the A/B (process-cache-2's alternating-flag probe measured exactly
    that). None = the flag file was malformed at decision time: the arm is
    UNKNOWN and recorded as such, never guessed.

    `slot_wait_s` is how long this admission waited to acquire the
    machine-wide `_turn_slots` seat (0.0 for a boundary-feed, which rides a
    seat the turn already holds rather than acquiring a new one). A stuck-mail
    incident (user report 2026-08-30) traced to a window this journal could
    not explain either way — a slot wait leaves no OTHER trace anywhere, so
    without this field the next occurrence would be just as unexplainable.

    ⚠ THERE IS DELIBERATELY NO `handshake_ms` FIELD IN ADMIT ROWS. One used
    to be written here as the literal `0`, and cache-misses measured it
    vacuous (2026-08-30): 0 in all 46 admit rows, cold spawns included. What
    makes that a finding rather than a guess is the control — `spawn_ms` in
    the SAME rows varies 0–483ms, so the journal does record varying values
    and that field specifically was dead.

    It stays removed because NOTHING AT THIS SEAM observes a handshake:
    Claude admissions still never wait for one (user ruling, module
    docstring), and the Codex prewarm handshake completes elsewhere — its
    real, measured interval is journaled by the finisher's own
    `prewarm-ready`/`prewarm-degraded`/`prewarm-failed` rows as
    `elapsed_ms`, against the process it actually timed.

    A MISSING FIELD IS HONEST; A PERMANENTLY-ZERO ONE LIES — and this one sat
    in the journal this whole effort steers by, where `handshake_ms=0` on a
    cold spawn reads as evidence the handshake was free, which is the
    opposite of what the audit found. Do not re-add it without a proof that
    it can be non-zero (coordinator-ruled 2026-08-30)."""

# Codex's project-doc discovery, MEASURED against the pinned codex 0.150.1
# with `codex debug prompt-input` (renders the model-visible prompt, no API
# call). Do NOT copy the Claude list across — the loaders differ, and hashing
# a file codex ignores would respawn agents for edits that change nothing.
#
# What the probe established, planting distinctive markers and reading back
# which ones reached the prompt:
#   * <cwd>/AGENTS.md            LOADED
#   * <cwd>/AGENTS.override.md   LOADED, and it SUPPRESSES AGENTS.md in the
#                                same directory (the managed identity vanished
#                                from the prompt when an override was planted)
#   * <cwd>/CLAUDE.md            NOT loaded. `project_doc_fallback_filenames`
#                                defaults to `[]` in the binary's own embedded
#                                defaults; codex's CLAUDE.md strings belong to
#                                its Claude-session IMPORT feature, not to
#                                project-doc loading.
#   * ancestors' AGENTS.md       loaded ONLY up to a `.git` project root
#                                (`project_root_markers = [".git"]`). With no
#                                marker anywhere the walk collapses to cwd —
#                                which is every orgtree seat today, since
#                                nothing above the scratch root is a repo.
#   * $CODEX_HOME/AGENTS.md      LOADED (verified with an isolated CODEX_HOME;
#                                the real one was never written to).
#
# ⚠ KNOWN BOUNDARY: a non-default `project_doc_fallback_filenames` in codex
# config would add filenames this digest does not know about. Not covered,
# deliberately — the proven default set is what gets hashed, and inventing
# coverage for unmeasured config is the failure this comment exists to stop.

    be read from a closed channel, so the registries drop it now and a
    replacement may spawn. The death bookkeeping — the exit row, `proc_live`,
    `process-ended` — is deliberately NOT done here. It belongs to
    `_finalize_proc_exit`, which runs only after `proc.wait()` has returned.

    While the process is still OS-live (or cannot be observed) the MCP
    surface is published as channel-closed/LOADING: G1 binds a live process
    to `loading | loaded`, and this is the window an unpublished surface used
    to strand in. When the exit is ALREADY observable at EOF the publish is
    skipped and the finalizer's sequence is byte-for-byte the one this
    function was split out of.

    THAT SKIP IS RARER THAN IT LOOKS, and the honest version is worth stating:
    `poll()` lags the EOF by about a millisecond on this machine, so an
    ORDINARY death usually arrives here still reading as live and does publish
    a transient `loading` — measured at 15/15 immediate deaths, roughly 1ms
    before `process-ended`. That is a cosmetic extra stream event, not a wrong
    state: at the instant it is published the OS genuinely has not yet
    reported the exit, and publishing anything else would be guessing. Do not
    "fix" it with a sleep, a retry or a poll loop; the correction arrives on
    its own, from an observation, which is the entire principle here.

    OS-LIVE, the seat's only process — is left with no surface at all. That is
    the G1 violation stated exactly: an active process whose MCP state is
    neither loading nor loaded.
