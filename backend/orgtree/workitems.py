"""Delivery-stage evidence for work items — the part that talks to git.

This module answers ONE kind of question for the docket: "does the orgtree
repository at REPO_ROOT hold commit X, and is X contained in <target>?" It
never reads or writes the org document (the ledger owns the item; `api.py`
sequences lock → capture → this module → revalidate → save, see
`docs/work-items.md`). Keeping git out of the ledger is what keeps git out of
`DOC_LOCK`.

What a stage result MEANS is deliberately narrow and is written into the
record (`method`/`detail`) rather than left to the reader:

  committed  the commit object resolves in REPO_ROOT. Not "is on main".
  pushed     the commit is an ancestor of the LOCAL tracking ref
             refs/remotes/origin/main — last-observed remote evidence, as of
             the moment this process looked at the ref. No network is used
             and NO fetch time is claimed: git keeps no reliable record of
             when a tracking ref was last fetched (`reflog --format=%cd` is
             the COMMIT date, not the ref update), so `fetched_at` is None.
  in_build   the commit is an ancestor of the commit this backend BOOTED from
             (restart_wake.get_boot_build_info). That is inclusion by git
             ancestry, NOT a functional check — and only when the boot tree
             was clean; a dirty boot cannot prove what code is serving. The
             build identity compared against is commit+dirty, so a later
             dirty boot at the SAME sha does not retain a verified inclusion.

Three-valued on purpose. `verified` is True/False only when git actually
answered the ancestry question; every other outcome — git missing, timeout,
a sha that does not resolve uniquely HERE (it may exist in another
repository), a dirty boot — is None with a `detail` that says which. A commit
that is not in this repository is UNKNOWN, not nonexistent (Astra ruling
2026-09-05).

Every subprocess is a list argv with shell=False, cwd=REPO_ROOT and a
timeout; the only caller-supplied string that reaches argv is a sha that
matched `_SHA_RE`, and the record stores the exact OID git resolved it to
(an ambiguous or unknown prefix stays unknown). Results are cached for 60 s
keyed by (repo, stage, sha, target identity) so a target that moves (a
fetch, a restart, a dirty tree) is never served a stale answer under the old
key.
