# ── the access record (D-239) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Until 2026-09-03 nothing in this system knew how long
# anything took. The log carried uvicorn's stock line —
# `INFO: 127.0.0.1:61975 - "GET /api/orgs/orgtree HTTP/1.1" 200 OK` — with no
# duration, no response size and no timestamp. Two days of 11-38 second
# requests sat in `backend.log` looking exactly like 12 ms ones: of 12,055
# lines, ONE carried anything duration-shaped. The regression was found by
# attaching py-spy to the live process, which is not a thing anyone should
# have to do to answer "which endpoint is slow".
#
# ⚠ INSTRUMENT THE BOUNDARY, NOT THE SPAN YOU SUSPECT. There already WAS a
# latency tripwire — `org_tree`'s "tree() took >1s" warning, written against a
# redteam's O(n²) `Org.children` finding. It never fired, for three reasons
# worth keeping: its timer stopped three lines short of `annotate`, which
# owned 91% of the request; it guarded a hypothesis rather than a surface, and
# the real cost arrived from a direction nobody had connected to it; and its
# `_tree_slow_warned` set only ever grew, so even a hit would have said so once
# and then gone quiet forever. A threshold that latches once per process tells
# you nothing about a trend. Hence: every request, at the outermost boundary,
# and a repeat window that RESETS.
#
# ⚠ THE ROUTE TEMPLATE, NEVER THE CONCRETE PATH, AND NEVER THE QUERY STRING.
# Not only because `/api/orgs/{slug}/nodes/{nid}/chat` aggregates and
# `/api/orgs/orgtree/nodes/perf-latency/chat?last=120` does not — but because
# this middleware sits on `app`, and the BRIDGE listener wraps that same
# object. Its uvicorn access log is deliberately suppressed in frozen mode
# (see `bridge_log` in `main`) because THE ORG CREDENTIAL RIDES IN THE URL:
# the frozen CLI cannot attach a private header. Logging concrete paths here
# would have quietly re-opened exactly that hole from a different file. A
# template carries no parameter values, so this is safe by construction on
# every listener rather than by a policy check someone can forget.
#
# This ADDS a line rather than replacing uvicorn's. Suppressing uvicorn's
# access log per listener is a security-reviewed decision in `main` (the
# bridge case above) and not worth reopening for log volume.

    ⚠ TWO DURATIONS, AND THE THRESHOLD USES THE FIRST. `handler` is time to
    `http.response.start` — the part this codebase can fix. `total` includes
    shipping the body, which for a virtual-disk download is physics, not a
    defect. Warning on `total` would fill the log with alarms about large
    files working correctly, and that is how a threshold gets ignored.

    ⚠ `inflight` IS NOT DECORATION — it is the field that would have caught
    the 2026-09-03 outage's most confusing symptom. "Agent chats no longer
    load" pointed at the chat handler, which measured 2.3-2.7 s throughout and

    ⚠ THE STAMPED NUMBER DESCRIBES A ROSTER THAT MAY NO LONGER EXIST.
    `frozen.until` / `until_ts` are written ONCE, at freeze time, from the
    account that hit the wall (supervisor, the `_ensure_frozen` block). Add a
    key, remove one, or reorder them and nothing writes them again — user
    report 2026-08-26: "the refresh time doesn't adapt to account changes or
    keys being added / removed". The record is the supervisor's to stamp, so
    the only honest place to CORRECT it is where it is read.

    ⚠ IT REPORTS CAPACITY, NEVER A WAKE — and that is the deeper half of the
    same bug. The old wording promised "resumes <time>", which is false on
    any org with `auto_resume` OFF (the default): nothing wakes the node when
    capacity returns, the operator does. User ruling 2026-08-26 — "off means
    off" — so a second account appearing is not consent nobody gave. This
    says what the ROSTER supports and leaves resuming to ▶.

    ⚠ THREE STATES, AND THE THIRD IS THE POINT. When no account carries a
    real refresh time there is NO T — an auth freeze marks no lane by design
    — and computing a plausible-looking countdown for it is exactly the
    invented-T failure the expired-login rule exists to prevent. It says the
    time is unknown instead. It also never SHORTENS a mark: it reads the
    marks rather than recomputing a horizon, so it inherits the pool `max()`
    floor by construction.

    Scope is deliberately narrow — a pure `limit` freeze that is not
    `limit_locked`. A connection freeze owns its own timer and both consumers
    render it down a separate branch; a fable weekly lock is not a
    subscription-pool question and `resolve` cannot describe it.

    `cache` memoises per tier for the life of ONE tree render: `resolve`
    re-reads the roster file per call, and a large org would otherwise pay
    that once per frozen node (the O(n²) warning above is already watching

    used to do in the calls AFTER `orgtree_hire` / `orgtree_rehire`: the
    retool-only scope fields, the audience grants, and the kickoff that
    actually starts the seat.

    User request 2026-08-27: hiring one agent took four calls (hire, retool,
    audience grant, kickoff message), and between them the seat exists but is
    not yet the agent that was described — a hire left at the org's default
    permission mode cannot act at all in a headless turn. Rehiring one took
    five, the extra being a rename.

    THREE PROPERTIES, in the order they matter.

    1. KICKOFF IS LAST, structurally rather than by convention. Nothing here
       starts a turn: `_notify` only queues (it never wakes, §7.4) and
       `mail_notify` is a UI animation signal with no state on it. The ONE
       wake path is `drive`, which `agent_call` consumes AFTER `store.save_org`
       and outside DOC_LOCK. So the seat's mode, scope and audiences are all
       persisted before its first turn can possibly begin. `audience_grant`
       wants to drive the grantee itself; we collect that instead of letting
       it through, and append the seat to `drive` exactly ONCE, here, at the
       tail — which also spares a fresh hire the pointless "Audience granted"
       wake the four-call version gave it.

    2. ALL-OR-NOTHING on partial failure. The caller is never told "hired"
       while quietly getting less than it asked for. This needs no new
       machinery: the whole dispatch already runs inside DOC_LOCK on an org
       freshly parsed from disk by `store.load_org`, and `store.save_org` is
       reached only if nothing raised. A bad audience target or an unknown
       folder in a later step therefore 422s with the failed step NAMED, and
       the node that `org.hire` created moments earlier is discarded with the
       unsaved doc — it never existed. Preferred over validating up front,
       which would mean a SECOND copy of each check sitting beside the real
       one, free to drift out of agreement with it.

    3. NO NEW AUTHORITY. Every step calls the same ledger method the
       standalone tool calls, with the same `actor` — `set_scope` for the
       scope fields (its own strict `_actor_cap` clamp caps permission_mode at
       the caller's own and refuses granting what the caller lacks),
       `audience_grant` for every target (which is also what makes 'user',
       a live peer and 'extern' the vocabulary here — it is that method's,
       not a second one invented for the shortcut), and `post_mail` for the
       kickoff. A shortcut that granted something the long way refuses would
       be a privilege escalation wearing a convenience's clothes.

    THE SEAT IS CREATED FIRST, THEN THE ITEM IS WRITTEN WITH THAT SEAT AS ITS

    give it an owner before the agent it is for exists — which means assigning
    it to its author and moving it a moment later, exactly the transient
    assign-to-author the user ruled against. This way the item's history
    contains ONE assignment, to the agent that actually holds it, and the
    notification names one recipient.

    Everything else is inherited rather than reimplemented: the seat comes from
    `_hire_seat` / `_rehire_seat` (the same code the standalone tools run,
    including their permission checks, `_seat_finish` and its all-or-nothing
    save), and the item comes from `work_create` / `work_update` (the same
    validation, the same assignment notification). Nothing here has authority
    of its own.

    """FR-31 (user request 2026-09-04): `orgtree_self_restart` with force.

    ⚠ ITS OWN BRANCH, RETURNING EARLY, AND THAT IS THE POINT. The ordinary
    self-restart keeps running through the big dispatch below with not one
    line changed — the default cannot regress because the default was not
    touched. Force is a separate, longer, noisier road to the same deploy,
    which is what the user asked for after watching a hand-rolled version of
    it lose a race: "a force switch is a loaded weapon, and its danger is
    exactly proportional to how easy it is to reach by accident".

    ⚠ AND IT HAS TO BE ITS OWN BRANCH FOR A MECHANICAL REASON TOO. The
    quiesce WAITS for other agents' turns to finish, and those turns need
    `store.DOC_LOCK` to book their cost — the same constraint written on
    `supervisor.interrupt_before_archive`. Run inside the dispatch's
    `with store.DOC_LOCK:` block, every wait would time out and the quiesce
    would report that nobody settled while in fact nobody could: a guard that
    runs, reports, and means nothing. So the order here is deliberate:

      1. AUTHORITY AND THE REASON, under the lock, and SAVED. The decision is
         on disk before a single turn is stopped, so a forced restart that
         kills this very process still leaves a record of who ordered it.
      2. THE QUIESCE, with no lock held — stop everyone, wait for them to
         settle. It takes the deploy hold first, so nobody woken in the
         meantime can get running behind us.
      3. THE LAUNCH, which owns that hold from here on either way.
      4. THE COST, recorded after, naming who was actually cut.

    Steps 2 and 3 are adjacent with nothing between them that can raise, so
    the hold cannot be orphaned in the gap."""

            FROM @user (…) · message · 2026-08-04T04:27:08.545Z
            <body>

        while still in flight. No clock is compared, only a string this

        ⚠ The body is used RAW. `_mail_block` writes `f"…· {at}\\n{m['body']}"`

        2026-08-04 on a real transcript sample: median 2.4 s, max 137 s). The
        composer trims, but nothing else does: the API takes `body.text` as
        sent, and agent mail routinely opens with a newline. Only the emptiness
        guard strips — and only where it must. With an `at` the marker is
        unique whatever the body is, so a whitespace-only message (nothing
        forbids one; only the composer trims) is identified like any other. It
        is only the legacy `at`-less entry that falls back to a bare body, and

    its provider's CLI is CONNECTED on this machine. Raises LedgerError (the
    ops/agent layers both turn that into a clean 422) NAMING the provider and
    the next step, in the order the user would take them.

    One gate for every provider-admission entry point, named so completeness
    is checkable instead of hidden behind a count:

      · user hire (`/api/orgs/{slug}/ops`),
      · agent hire (`orgtree_hire`),
      · user model switch (`switch_model` op),
      · agent model switch (`orgtree_switch_model`),
      · user rehire WITH a tier override,
      · user plain rehire on the archived node's stored tier, and
      · agent plain rehire (`orgtree_rehire`) on its stored tier.

    The two PLAIN rehire paths pass ``user_choice_only=True``. D-197 requires
    recovery to remain possible when an installed provider is merely signed
    out, so those paths skip transient install/connect checks. D-203 adds only
    the user's durable machine-wide admission choice to that recovery door.

    ⚠ CLAUDE IS GATED TOO SINCE D-199, and the note that used to sit here said
    the opposite: "Claude is ungated — its absence already fails loudly at
    spawn". Failing at spawn is not the same as refusing at the door. The user
    reported hire buttons for harnesses they had not set up, and the server was
    the other half of it: it ACCEPTED a Claude hire on a machine with no Claude
    (measured), spent the seat, created the node, and only then failed when the
    turn tried to run. The old note's fear — bricking every existing org on a
    transient detection bug — is answered by WHAT is detected: the CLI file
    this machine would actually spawn, plus a signed-in account, re-probed
    behind a 60s cache and never a network call.

    This list replaces the old load-bearing count. That count said "four"
    while rehire-with-a-tier was ungated, then said "five" while both plain
    rehire paths remained open. A named list makes the next missing call site
    visible without trusting arithmetic prose.

    Two provider-specific rulings ride along (user, 2026-08-28):
      · kiosks hold codex out until its sandbox story is settled;
      · a HEADLESS org may only hire tiers from KEYED providers — a
        subscription login is a person's plan, and headless means nobody is
        present to answer for it.

    The override is an ENV VAR (user ruling 2026-08-04, superseding the

    naturally and threading an argv flag through the deploy scripts to a
    detached process is the awkward path. Unattended hosts are the case that
    needs this, so the mechanism should suit them.

    ⚠ What the old ruling was protecting against is still true and is now
    handled elsewhere: env vars are INHERITED by child processes, so every
    agent CLI would see this one through `supervisor.clean_env()`. It is
    stripped there (it is not the agent's business whether the host is
