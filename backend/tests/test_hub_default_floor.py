"""A throwaway data root must never default to the operator's real mail hub.

THE HAZARD, WHICH HAS HAPPENED TWICE. A test rig mints its own ORGTREE_DATA
with `tempfile.mkdtemp`, creates fixture orgs in it, and - if that rig also
boots a backend - `net._participants` registers every one of them against
whatever `_default_address()` returns. A fresh data root has no defaults.json,
so that used to be `DEFAULT_HUB_ADDRESS`: the operator's REAL hub. The fixtures
landed in the live roster as selectable recipients that can never receive
anything. ~45 of them on 2026-08-06; again on 2026-08-10, after a fix that
covered three suites and missed a fourth which grew a live backend later.

Every repair before this one asked the RIG to remember to set
`net_hub_address`. THIS ONE DOES NOT, and that is the whole point - it is a
floor a rig author who has never heard of the hub cannot fall through.

`test_external_mail`'s hygiene assertion, which greps every rig for
`net_hub_address`, STAYS. It is the belt over this floor: it keeps naming the
rigs that rely on the default, so the day someone changes the default back the
list is already written. A red assertion that correctly detects a real hazard
is not noise (coordinator ruling 2026-09-04).

Falsifiers, all four verified to turn exactly their own group red:

M1 realpath -> abspath in `_under_os_temp`   -> group "spelling" FAILS
M2 drop the os.sep from the prefix compare   -> group "boundary" FAILS
M3 always return DEFAULT_HUB_ADDRESS         -> group "floor" FAILS
M4 ignore an explicit net_hub_address        -> group "explicit" FAILS

Hermetic: no org is created, no hub is contacted, nothing is registered. The
one check that reads the operator's real data root only asks where it is.
