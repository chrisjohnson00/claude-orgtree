"""A Codex agent's OS sandbox mode follows its orgtree permission_mode.

    python backend/tests/test_codex_sandbox_mode.py   (no pytest; plain asserts)

WHAT THIS GUARDS. `supervisor._codex_sandbox` decides what a model may touch
on the operator's real machine, and one of its three answers —
`danger-full-access` — turns the OS sandbox OFF entirely. Before 2026-09-04
orgtree never passed that value and picked between the other two from the
`edit` tool switch alone; a Codex seat could therefore commit but not write a
git ref in a shared checkout on another drive, because `workspace-write`
confines writes to the turn's cwd.

The rule under test:

    edit OFF                            -> read-only        (whatever the mode)
    edit ON,  permission_mode bypass    -> danger-full-access
    edit ON,  any other permission_mode -> workspace-write

BOTH SITES. The mode is chosen twice in supervisor.py — once for a normal turn
(`codexrun.CodexTurn`) and once for a compaction fork (`codexrun.compact_fork`).
§4 drives the compaction path separately and §5 requires the two to agree for
every combination, because a fix at one site only would let one agent run at
two different OS privilege levels depending on whether it happened to be
compacting.

WHERE THE ASSERTIONS LAND. Never on a helper this file wrote: §1-§3 record the
`sandbox=` keyword as `codexrun.CodexTurn.__init__` actually receives it (and
re-read `turn.sandbox`, the attribute `codexrun` puts on the `thread/start`
wire), and §4 records the keyword `codexrun.compact_fork` actually receives.
A test that called `_codex_sandbox` directly would prove only that the helper
returns what the helper returns, and would stay green if a call site were
reverted.

ANTI-VACUITY. §0 is the positive control: it plants a deliberately impossible
sentinel and requires the recorder to SEE that the real code overwrote it, so
"no full-access leak found" can never mean "the recorder never ran". §4 also
asserts the compaction completed, because `_compact_split_codex_body` wraps
its body in a bare `except Exception` that would swallow a broken fixture and
leave a recorded-but-meaningless value behind.

Hermetic: the codex CLI resolves (via ORGTREE_CODEX) to fakecodex.py, the
scripted app-server double, and ORGTREE_DATA is a throwaway temp root
established BEFORE `orgtree.store` is imported.
