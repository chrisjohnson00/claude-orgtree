"""D-181 — the appended system prompt must not churn with live org state.

    .venv/Scripts/python.exe backend/tests/test_prompt_cache_stability.py

No pytest. Plain asserts, `ok N` lines, one final `ALL N CHECKS PASS`.

WHY THIS FILE EXISTS
--------------------
`identity_prompt` is written to `.orgtree-identity.md` and handed to the CLI as
`--append-system-prompt-file` BEFORE EVERY SPAWN. The Anthropic prompt cache is
a strict PREFIX match, and `system` precedes `messages`. So one byte of drift in
that string discards the whole conversation cache and the agent re-pays its
entire context on a resume.

Before the split, that string carried live org state — the chart, the roster,
the credit balance, the org-wide fable lock, the open ask. MEASURED on this
machine 2026-08-29, from the CLI transcripts of 60 nodes / 1,441 resumes:

  · 68% of ALL resumes were cold
  · one hire changed 6 of 8 live agents' system prompts — six bystanders each
    re-paying a full context because a seventh agent was created
  · an org-wide fable_lock toggle hit 8 of 8
  · cold rate tracked how much org state a node rendered: org_visibility
    `self` 33% vs `full` 73%, and that gap survives a gap-length control
    (0% vs 55% cold at sub-60s gaps, so it is not TTL)
  · 196.6M cache-creation tokens on cold resumes vs 2.6M on warm ones

The fix was a RELOCATION, not a removal: `org_state_block` carries the volatile
half and rides the per-turn user envelope, where it costs its own tokens once
and leaves the cached prefix alone.

    §1  the system prompt is inert under other agents' movements
    §2  an agent's OWN scope change still reaches its system prompt
    §3  nothing was lost — every fact still reaches the agent
    §4  the turn envelope actually carries the block
    §5  ⚠ THE CHECKS ABOVE CAN FAIL — value-replacement mutants, each of
        which MUST break §1-§4. A green suite over a dead assertion is the
        failure mode this whole file exists to rule out.

⚠ ISOLATION. Every org here is named `zzpcs-*`, lives under a throwaway
ORGTREE_DATA, and is removed at exit.
