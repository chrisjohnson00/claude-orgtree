"""Crash-report intake (frontend/src/crashReporter.ts's server side) —
resolve_stack()'s server-side sourcemap resolution, save_report()/
list_reports() durability, and the /api/crash-report + /api/crash-reports
HTTP endpoints: mail delivery to a live "crash-reporting" node, save-only
behaviour for kiosk/public visitors, and durability that does not depend on
mail delivery succeeding.

Plain asserts; run with:  python backend/tests/test_crash_reports.py

§1  resolve_stack() against a REAL esbuild-built bundle + sourcemap — not a
    hand-rolled fake map, so a passing check proves the actual pipeline
    (vite's sourcemap='hidden' + postbuild move + @jridgewell/trace-mapping)
    resolves a genuine minified frame, not just "didn't throw"
§2  resolve_stack() falls back to the raw stack when no map exists — the
    witness that a missing/broken map degrades gracefully instead of losing
    the report
§3  save_report()/list_reports() persist newest-first, independent of org
§4  format_mail_body() carries breadcrumbs and the React component stack
§5  the HTTP endpoint: durable save even with no matching org, mail delivery
    to a live "crash-reporting" node, no delivery to an archived/missing one,
    and no delivery for a public/kiosk caller
