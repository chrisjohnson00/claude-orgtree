"""FR-05 reply attribution (5e2319b) — the snapshot a reply carries, and what
the agent is told it means.

A reply now ships a SNAPSHOT of the mail it answers — `{id, from, at, gist}`
captured at send — and `_mail_block` recites it to the agent as

    ↩ IN REPLY TO your message of ⟨at⟩: “⟨gist⟩”

That line is not decoration: it lands inside the agent's [MAIL] block, which is
the one place the agent learns who said what and with what authority. So the
questions are the ones you ask of any quotation — is it complete, is it
attributed to the right person, and can the quoted text pretend to be something
other than a quotation.

    §1  storage — the caps, the coercions, what is dropped, where it rides
    §2  the recital — what the agent actually reads
    §3  attribution — "your message" is an assertion; is it checked?
    §4  injection — and the control that says how much of it is NEW

Hermetic: in-memory orgs, no data root, no port, no CLI, no network.
