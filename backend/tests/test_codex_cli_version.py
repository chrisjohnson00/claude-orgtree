"""Codex CLI version drift, and the refusal message that used to blame it on
the account.

    python backend/tests/test_codex_cli_version.py

No real CLI, account or network is touched: every case drives
`codex_cli_version_status` through a synthetic `status` dict and a temporary
CODEX_HOME, and the inventory is replaced at its module seam.

WHAT THIS IS DEFENDING (2026-09-04, live). The pinned Codex CLI was 0.150.1,
installed 28 August and never refreshed by any script in this repo. OpenAI's
`model/list` gates rollout models on the reporting client version, so that pin
returned 9 model ids while 0.153.0 on PATH returned the same 9 plus
`gpt-6-astra` — same account, same auth, same code. The tier was invisible and
the refusal message said "the signed-in Codex account does not offer model
'gpt-6-astra'", which was FALSE and sent three investigations after the
account, the model id and the fetch, all of which were fine.
