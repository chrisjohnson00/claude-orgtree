"""Compaction, lineage and cross-process safety — the §8 axis, attacked adversarially.

    A compaction is a SPLIT, not an edit. After it, exactly one node still
    runs (the successor: same name, same slot, same credits, forked session)
    and exactly one more exists that never runs again (the predecessor: a
    knowledge bearer, archived, grant 0, read-only). Nothing may be stranded
    by the split — not a credit, not a message, not a subtree — and a split
    that FAILS must leave the node exactly as runnable as it was before.

Run:  .venv/Scripts/python.exe backend/tests/test_compaction.py
      --quick        fewer repetitions / shorter sweeps
      --hermetic     skip the live half entirely (seconds, no backend)
      --only <sub>   only checks whose label contains <sub>
      --port N       bind the throwaway backend here (default 7409)
      --keep         keep the rig directory and print its path

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Three halves, one file, `test_ledger.py` style (plain asserts, `ok N` lines,
no pytest — still not installed).

**Hermetic ledger** drives the lineage algebra straight against `Org`:
`compact_split`, `reseed`, `lineage_stack`, and every op that has a
bearer-specific rule (`dissolve`, `delete`, `retire`, `rehire`, `_move`,
`extern_recipients`). Bearers are the awkward case in all of them — a bearer
occupies its successor's slot, is archived but not retired, and can acquire
org children of its own — and three separate stranding bugs have already come
out of exactly that.

**Hermetic supervisor** drives the threshold arithmetic (`_after_turn`) and
the split bookkeeping without launching anything: which occupancy triggers a
split, which triggers the §8.3 oracle transition, what the cooldown does, and
what the doc looks like after each.

**Live** runs a real backend on its own port and data dir with a fake CLI that
can answer `--output-format json` — which is the only reason `_compact_split`
can complete at all — and then breaks the fork in every way it can break:
non-zero exit, an unchanged session id, empty stdout, unparseable stdout, a
hang past the timeout, the backend dying mid-split. After each one the suite
asks the same two questions: IS THE NODE STILL RUNNABLE, and WHERE IS THE MAIL.

Plus two measurements that are not really about compaction and are here
because nothing else covers them:

  * **cross-process safety** — `DOC_LOCK` and the `_IOLatch` are both
    per-process, and `ARCHITECTURE.md` says a second backend on one data dir
    "silently discards interleaved load-modify-save cycles". That is measured
    here, in real subprocesses, and the number is asserted rather than
    described.
  * **`ORGTREE_MAX_TURNS` fairness** — the cap is global, not per-org, so a
    busy org can starve a quiet one. Measured as a wait time.

THE CLI STAND-IN
----------------
`fakecli.js` is not modified. A wrapper (`compactcli.js`) is generated into
the rig dir at runtime and delegates to it, exactly as
`test_turn_lifecycle.py` does with `wrapcli.js`. The wrapper adds what this
suite needs and fakecli has no dial for:

  json fork    `--output-format json` — programmable: a fresh session id, the
               SAME session id (the "did it actually fork" guard), a non-zero
               exit, empty stdout, malformed stdout, or a hang. This is the
               compaction fork, and against stock fakecli it can only fail.
  usage        a programmable `input_tokens`, so occupancy — and therefore the
               compaction threshold and the oracle threshold — is a DIAL
               rather than a constant 1200.

Nothing here touches the user's data: its own ORGTREE_DATA, its own HOME, its
own port (7409 by default), every org deleted at the end.

    """USER BUG 2026-08-20: "after an agent is compacted its context still
    reads FULL until its next turn runs".

    Occupancy is read off the transcript, and every record in a transcript
    describes the prompt as it stood when that call was made. A compaction
    replaces the prompt without writing a record — so the newest record went on
    describing a prompt that no longer existed, and the agent reported the fill
    it had before, on the desk and through orgtree_read_transcript, until its
    next turn happened to append a record of the new one. Measured: 213k the
    moment the /compact finished, 59k after one trivial turn, no work in
    between.

    The rule this section pins: a boundary INVALIDATES what stands above it,
    the summary that replaced the history stands in until something measures
    the new session, and the stand-in says that it is one."""

    # harness copied the backend to a directory where the suite's own
    # `_REPO/backend` did not resolve, so every run imported the unmutated
    # checkout off PYTHONPATH and reported KILLED for everything, including a
    # no-op. See scratch/mutate.py, which now runs a control pair.)

# =============== 3a-bis. hermetic: proven cold namespace + occupancy policy
#
# D-214 replaces D-179's generic-idle proxy. An account/auth-lane change is a
# known namespace incompatibility immediately. Expiry is independently proven
# only by a positive same-lane receipt crossing its authoritative TTL. Both
# proof shapes still require the configured occupancy threshold; uncertainty
# never becomes permission to destroy context.
#
# ⚠ AND WHY OCCUPANCY STILL GATES A COMPACTION THAT COSTS NOTHING. It is worth
# writing down because the obvious objection — "a fallback is followed by only
# one or two more turns, so compacting could cost more than it saves" — assumes
# the compaction is itself a billed full-context call. `cheap_compact` is not:
# it makes NO API call at all (ledger.cheap_compact — archive the session as a
# bearer, assign a fresh `session_id`, done). There is no token cost to
# amortise and therefore no break-even in turns. What a needless swap spends is
# CONTEXT, and occupancy is the entire defence of it. Hence the pairing the
# checks below pin: a switch says the reload is expensive, occupancy says the
# session is big enough that losing it is the better trade, and neither alone
# is permission to fire.
