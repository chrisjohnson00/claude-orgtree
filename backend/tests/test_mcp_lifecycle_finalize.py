"""A channel closing is not a process ending — and something must still end it.

    python backend/tests/test_mcp_lifecycle_finalize.py

`_mcp_tool_count_end` refuses to reap a generation whose exit it has not
observed, and points at the lifecycle owner as the thing that later confirms
one. That confirmation existed on exactly ONE path — a serving turn waits
(`supervisor.py:9766`/`:9770`) and ends (`:9787`). For a PARKED process it did
not exist at all: `warmpool._pump_out` called `_on_proc_exit` once, at stdout
EOF, and nothing ever observed the death that followed. So the compliant
`loading` published at EOF was terminal: a dead Popen stayed the owner and its
count and names stayed published, indefinitely.

These tests drive the REAL objects — a real `subprocess.Popen`, a real
`WarmProc` with its real pump thread, and `warmpool`'s real teardown callers.
No test here calls `_mcp_tool_count_end` by hand; a hand-driven "second end"
proves only that the accounting function works when someone calls it twice,
which was never in doubt and is precisely what hid this defect.

ANTI-VACUITY IS ENFORCED IN THE TEST, NOT ASSERTED IN PROSE. The child closes
fd 1 with `os.close(1)`, not `sys.stdout.close()`. Measured on this host:
`sys.stdout.close()` left the parent's EOF read BLOCKED for the child's whole
1.5s sleep — it unblocked at process exit, and `poll()` then returned None only
transiently, so a test written that way can pass on the exit/poll race alone
while never once observing a channel closed on a live process. `os.close(1)`
produced EOF in 0.031s with `poll()` None. Every test below re-checks
`poll() is None` at the moment it observes the parked state, and fails if the
child got there by dying.

        bookkeeping on exactly that (`if was_tracked or wp.claimed`). Nothing
        published anything, so a killed generation stayed the MCP owner with
        its inventory intact until some successor's `begin` happened to
        supersede it.

        This is why the finalizer's lifecycle and MCP publishes are no longer
        under the registry gate: both carry a generation-identity check, which
        protects a successor properly, and registry membership never did.
        `discard` is NOT this case — a discarded process is still `claimed`,
        so the old gate passed and it was always finalized.
