"""A watchdog whose SUBJECT died — D-176. MEASURE THE SUBJECT, NOT THE WATCHER.

THE DEFECT THIS COVERS
----------------------
`inline-images@0` armed a file dog on a tier log, waiting for `RUN COMPLETE`.
The tier was killed about a minute after its owner's turn ended. The log's
last write was 21:20; the string it waited for was never going to be appended.
**The agent sat idle for ninety minutes believing it was waiting on a slow
run.** The dog was armed, healthy, and watching a corpse.

WHY THE OBVIOUS FIX IS A TRAP, MEASURED BEFORE ANY CODE WAS WRITTEN
-------------------------------------------------------------------
The diagnosis already existed. Reconstructing that dog's real numbers (535
checks, 4.5 h, never matched) and calling the SHIPPED `wd_health` on it
returns a warning — it always did, in the org doc, the whole time. Nobody was
ever told, because `wd_health` is PULL-ONLY: it answers a question you have to
already suspect the answer to, and an agent that believes it is waiting on a
slow job does not call `list`.

And the second half is why routing that same note to agents would have been
worse than nothing: **feed it a file that is demonstrably GROWING, with the
same age and the same check count, and it returns the identical sentence.**
An instrument that cannot discriminate becomes harmful the moment you act on
it — a false "your producer died" after every quiet hour trains everyone here
to ignore the one alert that matters. §1 pins both halves of that measurement,
because it is the reason this suite exists rather than a one-line change.

THE RULE, AND WHY THE COUNTER SHAPE IS LOAD-BEARING
---------------------------------------------------
An orgtree restart kills every watcher process on this machine, and surviving
restarts is a watchdog's advertised virtue. So "my watcher died" is evidence
about nothing. Every input here is a fact about the WATCHED THING, recorded by
a check that actually ran — and the counter is in **observations, not wall
time**, so downtime cannot accrue staleness: while orgtree is down, no checks
run and the counter simply stops. §2 pins that as a property rather than a
comment, and §4 is the restart-shaped canary the user's constraint demands.

WHAT EACH KIND CAN HONESTLY KNOW  (§3 file · §5 command · §6 process · §7 stream)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  file     NOTHING about death. A path does not know what writes it, so a dead
           producer and a quiet one are the same observation. Reported as
           STALENESS, in those words, and the dog is left ARMED. §3.
  command  Not "the command failed" — a `grep` waiting for a string exits 1
           on every check and that is HEALTHY. Only "the check could not be
           performed at all". Paused, not removed. §5.
  process  Already correct: a dead subject IS the event. §6 proves it, and
           proves a spent `pid:` dog stops pretending to guard anything.
  stream   Already correct: the engine owns the child and has its exit code.
           §7 proves it, and proves a restart re-spawns instead of reporting a
           false exit.

§8 is the other half of the task: watchdog children are spawned by the BACKEND,
not by the turn that armed them — and the create-time smoke run was leaking a
grandchild on every create, measured on the live box.
