"""The phantom external channel — dead sends, and the detach that ends them.

    python backend/tests/test_phantom_handle.py

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
An `external_handles` entry is injected into its holder's SYSTEM PROMPT every
turn, with the prompt telling the agent to send its answers there. Nothing
ever removed one. A panel that closed left a handle that was live forever:
the agent kept reporting into it, and every send returned a cheerful
`200 "delivered"` it could not act on.

Why that is worse than an ordinary stale-state bug, and why the fix is REMOVAL
rather than an announcement: the handle lives in the system prompt, not the
conversation, so a compacted agent knows the channel ONLY through that line.
It cannot discover the channel died — there is no message it failed to read.
It can miss a notice; it cannot read a line that is gone. D-166.

    §1  the signal itself — @mcp: is a pull transport, so a poll IS the
        heartbeat, and there was no record of one before this
    §2  half (b) — the detach, including the two ways it could do harm
    §3  half (a) — a send stops claiming delivery it cannot know about
    §4  D-158 — both halves, each with its real fault seeded, watching the
        checks fire

⚠ §2's most important check is not that a dead handle is dropped. It is that a
POLLING peer keeps its handle. A false detach breaks a working integration and
is diagnosed from the far side by someone who cannot see this machine; a late
detach only delays cleanup of something already dead. The suite is weighted
that way on purpose.
