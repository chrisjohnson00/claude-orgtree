"""Step 3 — the producers, family by family: every migrated producer mints its typed
event and the row body is BYTE-IDENTICAL to what the pre-typed producer wrote (B4).

The oracles below are the OLD producer code, copied verbatim at the moment each site
was migrated (breadcrumbs: "capture before editing each site"). They are the parity
witness: a renderer that drifts from the old text fails here, not in the field.

patched at the seam the fire path calls so no agent process is ever started.
