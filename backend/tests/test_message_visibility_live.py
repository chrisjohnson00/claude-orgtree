"""Message-visibility suite, LIVE half — a real backend, a fake CLI, real time.

    A message the user sent is on screen CONTINUOUSLY from the moment it is
    sent until the conversation ends, and NEVER appears twice.

Run:  .venv/Scripts/python.exe backend/tests/test_message_visibility_live.py
      --quick        one repetition per configuration (smoke)
      --reps N       repetitions per configuration (default 3)
      --only <sub>   only configurations whose label contains <sub>
      --port N       bind the throwaway backend here (default: first free)

WHAT THIS ADDS OVER THE HERMETIC HALF
-------------------------------------
`test_message_visibility.py` drives the world step by step, so it can visit
orderings a race only reaches sometimes. This one gives up that control to buy
the thing it cannot fake: **real concurrency**. A real uvicorn process, real
threads, the real turn loop, the real `DOC_LOCK`, real `POST /message` →
`_journal_drain` → subprocess launch, and a 20 Hz poller that sees only what a
browser would see.

The CLI is `fakecli.js` (the supervisor lets one in via `ORGTREE_CLAUDE_CLI`),
which makes the D-55 window — drain → transcript echo — a NUMBER. Sweeping it
across the danger zone and repeating each point is what turns "sometimes" into
a measurement: a race that fails one time in twenty has to be run enough times
to be caught, and a fixed delay says exactly which side of the window each run
was on.

Nothing here touches the user's data: its own ORGTREE_DATA, its own HOME (the
transcripts land there), its own port, and every org is deleted at the end.

# Measured 2026-09-03, on pristine main and going back an unknown distance:
# 0 checks passed, 40 failed, ZERO payload samples scored. Every failure was
# the same `HTTP Error 422` on the FIRST call of `make_org` — so no agent was
# ever hired, no turn ever ran, and the suite whose contract is "a message is
# on screen continuously and NEVER appears twice" was asserting nothing at
# all. A real duplicate-render bug shipped to the user underneath it
# (`ebc8f9e`), which is what a dark net costs.
#
# The cause is drift, not a bug in either side. `provider_hire_gate` refuses a
# Claude tier unless `accounts.live_identity()` reports a signed-in account,
# and that reads `~/.claude.json`. This rig points HOME at its own throwaway
# directory — deliberately, so transcripts land there and nothing the user
# owns is touched — so `~/.claude.json` does not exist and the gate answers,
# correctly, "Claude is not signed in".
#
# So satisfy the gate rather than relax it. The gate asks whether the machine
# this backend runs on is signed in; for the rig's own synthetic machine the
# honest answer is yes, and it already substitutes the CLI itself
# (ORGTREE_CLAUDE_CLI=fakecli.js) — this is the same substitution one layer
# down. `live_identity` reads CLI CONFIG METADATA and is documented never to
# touch the credentials store, so an `oauthAccount` stanza is the whole of
# what it wants; no real secret is read, copied or written anywhere. The

def real_cli_main() -> None:
    """`--real-cli`: the same probe, driving the REAL Claude Code CLI.

    Everything else in this file substitutes the CLI so timing can be a dial.
    Three questions cannot be answered that way, because they are facts about
    the CLI rather than about orgtree, and each one decides whether a fault
    line found in the hermetic suite is live or theoretical:

      ① Does the real CLI's first stdout event ever beat its own transcript
        write? `_confirm_delivered` retires the delivery journal on that event,
        while the desk renders from the transcript — if stdout wins, the
        message is briefly in no carrier at all.
      ② What is the real drain→echo window, cold and warm? That is the hole
        D-55 closed; its width is the exposure if it ever reopens.
      ③ Does mid-task steering leave the message visible once the hook has
        taken it? The hook's text reaches the transcript as a record shape
        `read_chat` cannot render, so the steered log is the only carrier.

    ⚠ Real turns, real cost. Tier is haiku (never fable — explicit ruling).
