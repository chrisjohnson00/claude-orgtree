"""Shared model for the message-visibility suite (the D-34/43/50/51/52/55 bug
family): *something was retired before its replacement existed*.

THE INVARIANT UNDER TEST
------------------------
A message the user sent is on screen CONTINUOUSLY from the moment it is sent
until the conversation ends, and NEVER appears twice.

"On screen" is the union of the three carriers an agent desk renders a user
message from, and the whole bug family lives in the hand-offs between them:

  ① transcript bubble   `chat.messages[] where role == 'user'`   (desk.tsx)
  ② pending row         `chat.pending_mail[] where from == '@user'`  (pendrow)
  ③ optimistic ghost    `convo.pending[]`                        (convo.ts)

② is itself two server-side sources fused in `api.node_chat`: the node's
mailbox (`org.d["mail"]`) and the delivery journal (`org.d["delivering"]`,
projected by `supervisor.delivering_mail`).

So the render count for one message at any instant is
    renders = ①hits + ②hits + ③hits
and the invariant is `renders == 1` at EVERY observation:
    renders == 0  →  a GAP       (the user's message vanished)
    renders >= 2  →  a DUPLICATE (D-55 found a 1.95-2.35 s one nobody reported)

WHY THE CLIENT RULES ARE PORTED HERE
------------------------------------
The graduation rule that retires ③ lives in the browser (`convo.ts`), and the
evidence it retires against is served by Python. Neither half can be judged
alone — D-51/52/55 were all failures of the *seam*. `Desk` below is a faithful
port of `convo.ts`'s `serverCopies` / `addPending` / `refreshConvo` graduation
and `desk.tsx`'s render union, so a Python test can drive real server code and
score it exactly as the browser would.

⚠ A port is a copy, and copies rot. `assert_client_model_matches_source()`
greps `convo.ts` and `desk.tsx` for the expressions this file mirrors and fails
loudly if they change — a silent drift here would turn the whole suite into a
test of a fiction.
