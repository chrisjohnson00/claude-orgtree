"""D-223: bounded-staleness suppression of the per-turn dynamic envelope.

The property under test is NOT "fewer bytes". It is "fewer bytes and the agent
still knows everything it could have acted on". Every check here is written
against that second half — what an agent would be missing if the rule fired
wrongly — because the failure mode is silent by construction: a suppressed
block leaves no trace of what it did not say.
