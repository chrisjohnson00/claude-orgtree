"""The Claude Code CLI pin, and the Fable 5.1 migration that needed it.

WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. The fable tier's default model id moved to
`claude-fable-5-1`, which exists only in CLI **2.1.257 and later** — measured
by grepping each published build's native binary for the literal id (2.1.220
absent, 2.1.251 absent, 2.1.252 absent, 2.1.257 present, 2.1.258 present;
2.1.253–256 were never published, so the floor is exact). The pin moved to
2.1.258.

THE MIGRATION HAZARD THIS SUITE EXISTS FOR. Two things move on different
clocks. The org doc's fable id migrates the moment the new CODE loads; the CLI
pin migrates only when a DEPLOY runs. Between them sits a machine whose orgs
ask for 5.1 and whose CLI has never heard of it — and 2.1.220 does not refuse
an unknown `--model`, it forwards it (measured against a dead endpoint:
`claude-fable-5-1` and a deliberately bogus id behave identically). There is no
loud local failure to catch, so every check below is about orgtree noticing on
its own.

    §1  the three numbers, and why they are three
    §2  the downgrade itself
    §3  the call sites actually READ it (a gate nobody reads is not a gate)
    §4  existing orgs migrate — and customised ones do not
    §5  the update scripts read the pin from the code, not from a literal
    §6  DRIFT GUARD: the frontend's version menu mirrors the ledger's
    §7  controls — what would make the above vacuous
