"""Watchdog ABSTENTION VISIBILITY — the suite for the 2026-08-22 fix.

THE DEFECT THIS COVERS
----------------------
`supervisor._wd_popen` hands a command/stream dog's target to `shell=True`
with the backend SERVICE's environment — not the agent's interactive shell.
Meanwhile `orgtree_watchdog` told agents a dog "runs WITH YOUR HANDS (needs
your bash)". Agents wrote for their own shell, the service's shell answered
"command not found", and the dog reported `state: armed, fired: 0` —
which is ALSO exactly what a healthy dog waiting on a condition reports.
Three dogs on this machine were dead that way for up to nine days.

The PATH is the accident. The defect is that **an abstention read exactly
like a pass**, which is this subtree's standing failure shape. So these
checks are about EVIDENCE, not about grep: that a dog which ran and saw
nothing says so, in words, in `orgtree_watchdog list`, and that a dog whose
target cannot run says so at CREATE time.

WHY EVERY CHECK HERE COMES IN A PAIR
------------------------------------
An all-green harness is the symptom, not the proof (team charter §3). Every
positive assertion below has a NEGATIVE twin that must come out the other
way — a healthy dog whose health line must stay "ok" next to a broken one
whose health line must not; a target that runs next to one that does not.
A check that can only ever pass has proved nothing.

Run:  python tests/test_watchdog_visibility.py
Mutation harness: MUTANTS.md next to this file lists the mutations that must
kill named checks here, with the control pair.
