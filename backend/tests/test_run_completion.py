"""Can this repo tell a KILLED test run from a passing one? — the acceptance suite.

Diagnosis 2026-08-26 (`task-timeouts`), measured rather than argued: work an
agent starts as a harness *background task* is a child of that turn's CLI, and
the supervisor closes that CLI's stdin at every turn boundary — so the job dies
when the turn ends, and so does any waiter started the same way. Two tier runs
died that way at 49 s and 36 s, having completed 19 and 25 suites with **zero
failures between them**. Their stdout was a column of `✓` and nothing else, and
a deploy was gated on one of them.

Nothing timed out. The point of this suite is not the killing — it is that the
killing was INVISIBLE. `tools/run_tests.py` now ends a run with two artefacts
written together (`emit_completion`): a final `RUN COMPLETE …` stdout line and
a `COMPLETE` file in the log directory. Their absence is the signal.

    §1  a run that finishes says so — both artefacts, and they agree
    §2  a run that is KILLED mid-flight produces NEITHER
    §3  the retroactive discriminator — log count vs the plan header — which
        is the only one that works on the ~800 runs already on disk
    §4  a run that FAILED still finished: rc travels in the line, not in the
        marker's presence

⚠ §2 IS THE CHECK THAT CAN FAIL, and it is worthless unless the kill actually
landed on a run that was actually running. So it proves both before it reads
the result: the child is confirmed gone, and its captured stdout is confirmed
to show a run in progress. A kill that missed, or a run that never started,
would BOTH leave the marker absent and pass a naive version of this check for
entirely the wrong reason.

This suite shells out to the real runner — no mocks. It is deliberately cheap:
the completing run is one fast suite, and the killed run is stopped the moment
it proves it started.
