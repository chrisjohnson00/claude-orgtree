"""The access record — the one line per request that D-239 was missing.

Run directly::

    python backend/tests/test_access_record.py

WHY THIS SUITE EXISTS
---------------------
On 2026-09-03 `GET /api/orgs/{slug}` spent two days answering in 11-38 s and
nothing noticed, because the log carried uvicorn's stock line and that line has
no duration, no size and no timestamp. Of 12,055 lines in `backend.log`, one
carried anything duration-shaped. The regression was eventually found by
attaching py-spy to the live process.

So the record is not a nicety, it is the instrument. These checks are aimed at
the four ways an instrument like this quietly stops being one.

    §1  it measures at all, and reports the fields a diagnosis needs
    §2  it cannot leak a credential — the SECURITY property, see below
    §3  the alarm fires
    §4  …and its rate limit RESETS, which is the whole difference between a
        threshold and `_tree_slow_warned`
    §5  a request that FAILS is still recorded
    §6  `inflight` really counts concurrency
    §7  every line it prints can actually reach the log
    §8  …and the stream it reaches accepts what the rest of the codebase prints

⚠ §2 IS A SECURITY CHECK, NOT A TIDINESS ONE, and it is why the record logs a
route TEMPLATE rather than a path. This middleware sits on `app`, and the
BRIDGE listener wraps that same object, and THE ORG SECRET RIDES IN THE
`/anthropic/<secret>/…` URL — the CLI cannot attach a private header. A record
that logged concrete paths would write that secret to the log, and it would do
so silently, on a listener no one was thinking about while writing a
performance tool. Templates carry no parameter values, so the
property holds on every listener without a policy check anyone can forget.

⚠ §4 IS THE ONE THAT ENCODES THE LESSON. The system already HAD a slow-request
warning — `org_tree`'s "tree() took >1s" — and it never fired. One reason was
`_tree_slow_warned`, a set that only ever grew: the warning could fire at most
once per org per process, so it could not have described a problem getting
worse even had it been pointed at the right code. A rate limit that never
resets is not a rate limit, it is a latch. This suite proves the window
reopens AND that the requests suppressed inside it are counted rather than
lost, because "it is still slow, 47 more times" is the sentence that turns a
log line into a diagnosis.
