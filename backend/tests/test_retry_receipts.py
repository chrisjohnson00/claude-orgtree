"""Phase 2 of w71d69aac — the operations a dying turn COMMITTED, named in the
retry banner (supervisor.resume_frozen + opreceipts.applied_since).

The net-retry banner tells the agent "whatever that turn had already done was
not undone — check your real state". Operation receipts can say WHICH org
operations that turn committed. This suite measures the claims that make
that list truthful rather than decorative:

  §1  `applied_since` — node, outcome and the inclusive bound; generation is
      not a filter; a row that does not parse drops out, never in; the
      server's filing stamp counts, not the client's mint time.
  §4  the renderer and the composer on their own: empty renders nothing, the
      payload is never inspected (markers inside it survive byte for byte),
      the row cap.
  §2  the REAL freeze branch (synthetic CLI, `died-in-flight`) records the
      bound as the ATTEMPT'S START, not the death time; attempt 2 keeps the
      run's origin; a completed turn pops it.
  §3  `resume_frozen` recomposes the banner from its STORED parts — exactly
      ONE paragraph, replay TEXT only — listing a row filed between attempt
      start and death and a row filed AFTER the freeze (the request that was
      on the wire), view byte-identical; an empty log leaves the text
      byte-identical; a payload containing the markers is untouched; a retry
      of a retry (the resumed carrier dies again, through the real loop)
      carries ONE banner, ONE paragraph, the payload once.

§2/§3 borrow test_limit_freeze's rig (throwaway ORGTREE_DATA + HOME, the
synthetic CLI, no port, no network) by importing it FIRST — it binds the
store to its own tmp root before `orgtree` is imported here. They need
`node` on PATH and declare themselves INERT (loudly) without it.
