"""VERIFIED HANDOFF RECORD — the production module and its publication door.

    python backend/tests/test_handoff_record.py     (plain asserts)

Audit §3 / reset-action-plan item 15; contract in
`mail-ack-contract/handoff-contract.md` v2 (Astra-approved 2026-09-05,
staged-directory publication). The prototype probe
(`evidence/handoff/probe_handoff_contract.py`) proved the contract against a
STAND-IN module. This suite drives the SHIPPED code: `orgtree.handoff` and
the real `supervisor.export_predecessor_transcript`, through a real
`ledger.switch_model` crossing in a throwaway data root.

What each section establishes:

  §1 a record built from a fixture containing every excluded thing (private
     reasoning, a signature, a sidechain row, a compaction summary, an
     outside-grant write, an orphan tool result, a machine envelope) verifies
     ANCHORED and leaks none of them; the build is deterministic.
  §2 ARTIFACT FORGERIES are each rejected, and the two DECLARED
     LIMITS of the contract (a consistent forgery of a captured view row or
     seat passes without its anchor) are asserted as limits, not as passes.
  §3 a zero-omission input verifies clean — the anti-vacuity control for §1:
     the omission machinery can report nothing AND can still be caught lying.
  §4 escaping: quotes, backslashes, tabs, newlines, unicode round-trip; a
     re-escaped quotation is caught.
  §5 PUBLICATION: staged directory + one rename. A failing verify, a failing
     render or a failing rename leaves NOTHING under the published name and
     no staging directory behind; the same generation is never overwritten;
     `read_generation` refuses a manifest-less, corrupted or truncated
     directory.
  §6 the REAL DOOR: a real cross-provider `switch_model` +
     `export_predecessor_transcript` publishes `handoff-g<gen>/`, and that
     record verifies against the live sidecar rows, node doc and mailbox.
  §7 all eight call sites — covering nine boundary doors, since the
     org-wide and subtree bulk sweeps share one via `_export_compacted` —
     go through that one function (source scan, with the count asserted so
     a new door cannot be added silently).
  §8 FLAG-OFF COMPATIBILITY, measured against THIS BUILD with the handoff
     block neutralised: with `handoff.flag` absent the identity prompt is
     BYTE-IDENTICAL to the one the same code builds when `_handoff_block`
     returns nothing at all, and the boundary adds no notice. Positive
     control: with the flag on the two differ, by exactly the block.
  §9 generation-specific lookup: the successor reads g<generation-1> only; a
     stale older generation and a corrupted current one are not spliced.
  §10 the boundary is best-effort: a record that cannot be built or does not
     verify leaves the transcript copy and the split intact.
  §11 TWELVE MUTANTS of the shipped code, each asserted to turn a NAMED check
     of this suite red (a check that cannot fail is not a check).

Review round 2 (Astra, 2026-09-05) added, in §1 and §5: every private form any
lane actually persists — including the codex leg's reasoning item, which its
writer stores in Claude's own `thinking` shape with `signature: "codex"` — and
the block/row forms this code does not know, which are admitted by NOTHING and
counted by type name; a TRUNCATED leak (300 chars of a thinking block) that
whole-string containment cannot see, with a false-positive control so that
reasoning quoting the user verbatim does not make a record unpublishable;
eleven malformed-but-valid-JSON manifests that must answer "no record" rather
than raise on the identity-prompt path; and the boundary reason, which is the
door's own rather than a guess from tier equality.

Hermetic: own throwaway `ORGTREE_DATA` asserted not to be the live root, no
backend process, no network, no provider call, no write outside the temp
dirs and this repository's worktree.
