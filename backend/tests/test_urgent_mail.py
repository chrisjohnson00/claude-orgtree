"""D-169 urgent mail — the ledger half: the gate, the pair, and the count.

    python backend/tests/test_urgent_mail.py      (no pytest; plain asserts)

An agent may tag user-bound mail urgent; the user's inbox then pulses the way
it does for an unanswered question, until the mail is read. This file owns the
server-side mechanics. The pip rule that consumes the count is a frontend
value and is tested in frontend/tests/urgentpip.test.tsx.

WHAT "READ" MEANS HERE, because the whole design hangs off it. `user_inbox`
IS the unread set: POST /inbox/read moves an entry out of it into
`user_mail_log`. So `urgent_unread` is derived from that one list and falls to
zero on exactly the read event — there is no second seen-stamp that could
leave the pulse stuck on after the mail was read. §4 is that property.

⚠ WHY EVERY MISUSE REFUSES RATHER THAN DEGRADING. A dropped urgent flag is the
WON'T-FIRE failure: the sender believes it raised the alarm, the user is never
interrupted, and nothing says so. That is strictly worse than an over-eager
alarm, which at least announces itself. So §2 pins that each bad call raises
instead of quietly posting ordinary mail — including the blank reason, which
is the D-168 shape (an abstention wired to the passing branch) pointed at a
human process: accept `reason=""` once and every call carries it within a
week.
