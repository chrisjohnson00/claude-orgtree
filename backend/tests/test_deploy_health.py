"""The post-deploy state assertion: `tools/deploy_health.py`.

WHAT IT GUARDS.  The deploy script used to end its deploy by asking `/api/orgs` for
an HTTP 200.  An empty list is a perfectly good 200, so a backend that came up
carrying NONE of the install's orgs deployed green -- the exact sequence being:
the SQLite cutover ships, the code is rolled back without the data, the JSON
build finds no `<slug>.json` (only `<slug>.db` + `<slug>.json.premigration`),
honestly presents zero orgs, and the deploy script blesses it.

THE POINT OF THIS SUITE IS THE RED, NOT THE GREEN.  Section 2 drives the
checker against a backend that is UP and serving zero orgs while three exist on
disk, and asserts it fails -- with §2.0 first establishing that the old
"200 is healthy" rule would have passed that very fixture.  A check only ever
seen green is a check nobody has tested.

    §1  the expectation: what the data root says must exist
    §2  the verdicts, end to end against a programmable /api/orgs
    §3  the budgets: it cannot hang a deploy
    §4  the deploy script runs it, and does not settle for a 200
    §5  it is a SECOND source of truth (it imports no orgtree)
    §6  controls -- what would make the above vacuous

Nothing here touches the live install: every fixture is a temp directory and a
loopback HTTP server on an ephemeral port.  No orgtree module is imported at
all, by this suite or by the code under test.
