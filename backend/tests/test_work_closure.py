"""`dropped` as the TERMINAL NON-SUCCESS outcome: the reason it owes, the
archive it earns, and the Done it must never become.

Run: python backend/tests/test_work_closure.py

The problem this pins, as it stood before: `dropped` existed and closed an item,
but only `done` was ever swept into the archive, so cancelled and unrecoverably
failed work sat on the main docket list for good; nothing recorded WHY the work
ended; and the doctrine never named the status at all, which left "walk it
through review and accept it" as the only way to get dead work off the list —
a completion written into the record that never happened.

Everything runs through the real ledger and the real route table on a throwaway
data root. No clock is waited on: the hour is crossed by backdating `docket_at`,
which is the same instrument test_work_items uses for the done edge.

CONTROLS, because a check that cannot fail is not a check: a `done` item must
still archive on the hour clock (and NOT before it — the strict edge), a
`dropped` item must archive AT ONCE (user 2026-09-07: "no 1-hour timeout for
them"), a `superseded` item must still never archive by itself (that exemption
is deliberate — see §2), and an item dropped BEFORE this rule existed must stay
reopenable without anyone inventing a reason for it.

THE RENDERING IS COVERED ELSEWHERE, not here: frontend/tests/docket.test.tsx
§36 (extended) proves the pane picks the reason by STATUS with all three
fields planted, and §38 proves the row reads as an outcome that is not Done.
