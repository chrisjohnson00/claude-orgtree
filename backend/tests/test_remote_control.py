"""FR-01 remote control (b71a16d) — the park, and whether it actually parks.

`remote-control` hands the user's phone the agent's REAL session id. The
feature's entire safety argument is one sentence from its own header comment:

    "Two writers on one session id is the hazard, so while the server runs the
     node is PARKED."

So the suite asks one question in several ways — CAN A SECOND WRITER STILL GET
ON THE SESSION? Everything else (the refusals, the flag, reconcile) is checked
because it is the machinery that answer depends on.

    §1  the gates — who may start it, and what it refuses
    §2  the park — mail, commands, and the other spawn paths
    §3  the race — start is not atomic, and a turn can win the window
    §4  the exit — release, reconcile, and what happens to a leashed server
        whose node stops existing

The CLI stand-in logs every invocation with its session id and its mode, so
"two writers on one session" is a MEASUREMENT (two live rows, same sid), not an
inference from the code.

Hermetic: throwaway ORGTREE_DATA + HOME, no port, no Docker, no real CLI, no
network. Spawns `node` — skipped with a note if absent.
