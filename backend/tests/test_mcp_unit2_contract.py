"""UNIT 2 — a channel closing is not a process ending.

    python backend/tests/test_mcp_unit2_contract.py

Hermetic: no CLI, no fake CLI, no network, no listener. These drive the state
functions directly, so they hold on every provider.

THE DEFECT. `_mcp_tool_count_end` is the only producer of the terminal MCP
readiness state, and it published `process-ended` unconditionally. On the
Claude lane its trigger is a stdout EOF raised from the pump thread's `finally`
(`warmpool.py:391`) — and a channel closing is not a process exiting. A CLI
that closes stdout while its background children are still running is alive;
`proc exit reason="background-children"` is a measured case on this machine.
So a live agent was published as ENDED, on the strength of an event that proves
only that we stopped being able to hear it.

THE SHAPE OF THE FIX, and why it is this shape:

  · The claim is narrowed to what was observed. `poll()` returning an exit code
    proves the process is gone and still publishes `process-ended`. `poll()`
    returning None proves it is alive. Anything else proves neither, and the
    unobservable case is NOT folded into "dead" — asserting an exit nothing saw
    is the same error one layer along.

  · A live generation is NOT REAPED AT ALL. An earlier draft answered this
    trigger with a terminal state called `withdrawn`, justified by defining
    `active` as "eligible to serve a turn" — true, since `_on_proc_exit` has
    already removed the generation from `_pool` and `_serving`. G1 (Orgtree,
    2026-09-02) held that the word is not ours to narrow: `active` means
    OS-live, and a process the OS still lists owes the reader `loading` or
    `loaded` whatever our own bookkeeping says. That is the right call, and it
    is the same error this chain has been removing everywhere else — making a
    claim true by shrinking the term inside it rather than by observing.

    So the owner stays, the last observed inventory stays, and readiness says
    `loading` with the channel-closed fact as its reason. The inventory is
    kept because the owner is still current: `_mcp_tool_surface_for_owner`
    answers from the live entry rather than the stash, so clearing it would
    hand the turn boundary `(None, None)`, which POPS `last_turn_mcp_tools`
    and strips the gate's baseline — the defect `ae101e6` removed.

  · Termination is a CONFIRMED LIFECYCLE TRANSITION. A lifecycle caller that
    later observes the exit calls `_mcp_tool_count_end` again; that call sees
    the exit code and publishes `process-ended` truthfully. If no later exit is
    observed, a replacement generation supersedes the old owner in the normal
    begin path. No timer, no probe, no kill, and stdout silence is never
    treated as evidence of death.

  · It could not have been `loaded`. The last-known surface really is accurate
    at the instant of the EOF (MCP tools do not unregister because a pipe
    closed), but it decays and nothing can tell us it has: the channel that
    would report a RefreshMcpTools or a crashed MCP server is the one that just
    closed. `loaded` is present tense. Asserting it would be a cached answer
    standing in for an abstention — the defect class this whole chain removes.

  · No inventory re-observation probe exists on the Claude lane and none is
    pretended.
    Every caller of `_mcp_tool_count_names` reads the stdout that just closed
    (`supervisor.py:8425`, `:8791`, `warmpool.py:375`), so a "degraded pending
    a probe" state would be permanently pending there. The recovery that does
    exist (`b236c72`) is defence in depth: if another path empties a live
    generation's seat and it speaks again, its authoritative inventory can be
    accepted again.

  · Recycling stays out. Live background children are a concrete unsafe state
    and at least one node here carries a standing instruction not to be killed
    without user authority. An accounting function must not be able to end
    processes; the lifecycle owner has the attempt counters and the
    background-child awareness that a safe recycle needs.

WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT BUILT, so nobody reads a gap as an oversight. The
design (`unit2-design.md` §4b) also specifies a bounded re-observation probe on
the CODEX lane, where the JSON-RPC transport survives the trigger and a probe
genuinely can be scheduled. It is not implemented here. `b236c72` already
recovers that lane the moment any ordinary request enumerates, which on a
    serving node is the next turn; a dedicated probe would add retry, backoff and
    storm-guard machinery to accelerate a recovery that already arrives. The
    `loading` state is not waiting for that probe: a confirmed lifecycle exit
    retires it and a replacement supersedes it. §§7 pins the ABSENCE of a
    scheduled transport probe so that adding one later requires an explicit
    contract change.

    §1  a spurious EOF never reports the surface as ready/loaded
    §2  a live generation stays ACTIVE and LOADING, and is never claimed ended
    §3  the durable last-known surface survives it
    §4  nothing in this layer is keyed on elapsed time
    §5  the readiness layer touches nothing but `poll()` — it cannot kill
    §6  the loading state resolves, and only a confirmed exit resolves it
    §7  the transport is never probed; the bound is structural, not a counter
    §8  an OBSERVED death still reaches `process-ended` immediately

The recovery path itself (`b236c72`, and the pre-lock window its liveness probe
must not be gated on) is covered in `test_mcp_tool_count.py`, next to the other
generation-ownership tests, rather than duplicated here.
