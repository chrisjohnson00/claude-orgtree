"""The automatic upgrade off JSON: `tools/preflight_store.py` and its wiring.

WHAT THIS SUITE IS.  Two kinds of check, and the difference matters.

  * §1-§3 RUN THE THING.  `tools/preflight_store.py` is executed as a
    subprocess against data roots this file builds, and its exit code is the
    assertion.  These are not text searches; they would catch a rewrite that
    kept every keyword and changed every answer.
  * §4-§5 are TEXT PINS on `update.sh`, because the deploy script cannot be
    executed from here without stopping a backend.  They pin the handful of properties that were
    established by reading and that a later edit would silently undo -- above
    all THE ORDER: the pre-flight must sit after the pull and before the stop.

WHY THE ORDER IS THE THING WORTH PINNING.  main defaults to
`ORGTREE_STORE=sqlite`.  The install this whole feature exists for is one that
is still on JSON, and *its* checkout still defaults to `json` until the pull
lands.  A pre-flight moved to the top of the file would therefore read "JSON
code, JSON root, all fine", do nothing, and be perfectly green here forever --
present, plausible and inert, on exactly the population it was written for.
So §4 asserts positions, not presence.

    python backend/tests/test_deploy_preflight.py

Hermetic: builds its own roots under a temp dir, never reads or writes any
real data root, starts no backend and opens no port.
