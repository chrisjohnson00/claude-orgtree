"""D-200 — ONE-SHOT DOGS: fire exactly once, then remove yourself.

THE DEFECT THIS COVERS
----------------------
A watchdog whose readiness condition encodes a DEADLINE rather than an EDGE is
permanently true once the deadline passes, so a persistent dog on one re-fires
every interval, forever. `d181-population-bar` did exactly that on this
machine on 2026-08-30: `READY=yes WHY=24h deadline reached` stayed true, and
the dog woke its owner every 15 minutes with an identical verdict until the
owner removed it by hand. `once: true` is the fix.

WHY THE CHECKS ARE SHAPED THE WAY THEY ARE
------------------------------------------
Two failure shapes make a naive suite here green and worthless, and both are
named in the brief that commissioned this:

1. "It removed itself" is unfalsifiable unless the instrument is shown able to
   see a dog that did NOT remove itself. Every removal assertion below is run
   against a PERSISTENT twin created in the same org, fired the same way, in
   the same tick, which must still be there afterwards. If the twin also
   vanishes, the check is measuring the harness and not the feature.

2. "It fired exactly once" is satisfied by a dog that never fires at all —
   zero is not one, but a count that can only ever be 0 or 1 cannot tell them
   apart. So the persistent twin is the WITNESS THAT TWO WAS REACHABLE: it is
   fired the same number of times against the same permanently-true condition
   and must reach 2. Only against that witness does the one-shot's 1 mean
   anything.
