"""D-180: a codex node's GRANTED external MCP servers reach its app-server —
and the identity prompt promises exactly that set, never more.

    python backend/tests/test_codex_mcp_grant.py    (no pytest; plain asserts)

The defect this suite pins: `_codex_leg` built its tool set from
`mcptool.TOOLS` alone and never looked at the node's `mcp` scope, while
`identity_prompt` announced "MCP servers available to you: …" regardless of
lane. The identity ASSERTED a capability the lane dropped, and an assertion
reads to an agent exactly like the capability.

Two things are therefore proven together, because they are one bug:
  · DELIVERY  — the granted servers ride `-c mcp_servers.…` on the app-server
    launch (measured against the real codex 0.150.1: the server process is
    spawned, handshaked and its tools listed).
  · PROMISE   — `identity_prompt` is built from the SAME `codex_mcp_grant`
    call the spawn uses, so the text and the capability cannot drift.

Anti-vacuity: §2 and §5 plant a server the lane CANNOT express and require the
suite to see it disappear from BOTH the config and the prompt; §5 additionally
plants a deliverable server and requires it to APPEAR. A test that asserted
only absence would pass just as well against a function that returns nothing,
so every "not there" check is paired with a "there" check on the same run.
