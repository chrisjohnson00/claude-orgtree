"""Turn-lifecycle suite — the supervisor's stateful core, attacked adversarially.

    Mail is AT-LEAST-ONCE. A message the user (or an agent) posted is, at
    every instant and after every crash, still carried by SOMETHING that will
    deliver it: the mailbox, the delivery journal, an in-flight turn record, a
    freeze's resume text, or the agent's own transcript. Duplicates are the
    price and are fine. Losses are not.

Run:  .venv/Scripts/python.exe backend/tests/test_turn_lifecycle.py
      --quick        one repetition / a short sweep per configuration
      --only <sub>   only checks whose label contains <sub>
      --hermetic     skip the live half entirely (seconds, no processes)
      --port N       bind the throwaway backend here (default 7401)
      --keep         keep the rig directory and print its path

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Two halves, same file, same style as `test_ledger.py` (plain asserts, `ok N`
lines, no pytest — still not installed).

**Hermetic** drives the journal primitives directly against real org docs on
disk: `_envelope` → `_journal_drain` → `_confirm_delivered` /
`_fold_back_undelivered` / `pop_steer`, plus the pure predicates
(`_looks_like_usage_limit`, `_parse_limit_reset_ts`, `_ensure_frozen`). These
are the pieces every crash path lands on, and they are cheap enough to sweep
exhaustively.

**Live** runs a real uvicorn backend on its own port and data dir with a fake
CLI, and then kills things: the backend at seven points across one turn, the
CLI at five, the turn by timeout, the turn by interrupt. After every death the
suite asks the same question — WHERE IS THE MAIL — and refuses to accept
"nowhere".

THE CLI STAND-IN
----------------
`fakecli.js` (the substitution `ORGTREE_CLAUDE_CLI` already allows) does the
timing dials. Three turn shapes it has no dial for are added by a WRAPPER
generated into the rig dir at runtime (`wrapcli.js`) which delegates to
`fakecli.js` for everything else — so fakecli.js itself is untouched:

  json        `--output-format json` (the compaction fork and the /context
              one-shot) — fakecli only speaks stream-json, so `_compact_split`
              could never succeed against it
  die         exit before reading stdin at all (the "child dies on argv"
              case C1 exists for)
  errresult   consume the message, write NOTHING to the transcript, and answer
              with an is_error `result` — the shape that turned out to lose
              mail (§ defect 1)

Nothing here touches the user's data: its own ORGTREE_DATA, its own HOME, its
own port (7401 by default), every org deleted at the end.

    of THIS suite at once both bound the same number. The loser did NOT fail
    cleanly: it got through the hermetic half and then failed inside the live
    section with shaped, plausible mail-redelivery errors — "carried by
    [mailbox]" passing while "the next turn delivers it" failed — which reads
    exactly like a product defect and cascades into a dozen "section aborted"
    entries behind it.

    of an unrelated commit.

    ⚠ ORPHANS ARE NOT WHY THE FIXED NUMBER WAS HERE, so nothing is lost by
    dropping it: the test runner starts each suite in its own session and
    kills the whole process group on timeout, rig backend included. The fixed
    port's remaining effect was to make concurrent runs of this suite collide.

    Binding port 0 and closing leaves a window before the rig binds it, so the

    an unconfirmed delivery batch, an inflight command) by stopping the
    backend, editing its document, and starting it again. Under JSON that was
    a `json.dump` over `DATA/orgs/<slug>.json`. Under SQLite there is no such
    file, and writing one is worse than useless: it leaves a stray `.json`
    beside the `.db`, which the migration wall counts as an unmigrated org
    and REFUSES TO START on — naming orgs the suite had already deleted.

    `store._write_doc(conn, d, None)` is the plain-dict arm of the save
    transaction: every key upserted, every node written, every log section
    rewritten, and whatever the database holds that `d` does not is deleted.
    That is exactly the semantics of replacing the whole JSON file, which is
    what these sites mean.

    Three disciplines, all of them `doc()`'s:
      · an explicit path under `DATA`, never `store._POOL` — the pool keys on
        SLUG and resolves through `store.DATA_ROOT`, which in this process is
        the HERMETIC root, so a pooled connection could write the wrong
        database entirely;
      · `create=False` (the default), so planting a document for a database
        that was never written RAISES instead of minting an empty one — a
        silent empty org is the failure mode this whole flag exists for;
      · one explicit `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` … `COMMIT`, the same transaction
        `_save_sqlite` wraps `_write_doc` in, so a half-written plant rolls

    """USER BUG 2026-08-20: background subagents "die on their own" and the
    agent that launched one waits forever for a completion that never comes.

    Two agents lost their redteam reviewers, twice each. The cause was not the
    CLI and not compaction — it was THIS supervisor's idle watchdog. A
    backgrounded Task/Agent keeps running INSIDE the CLI process after the
    turn's result event; orgtree closes stdin at that boundary and the
    parent's stdout goes quiet while the child works. `_dog` read that silence
    as a wedge and SIGKILLed a perfectly healthy CLI at exactly TURN_IDLE
    (measured on the real transcripts at 600.258s and 600.0s after the
    parent's last event — the constant, to a quarter second). The subagent
    died with it, and so did the completion notification the CLI had already
    queued for its own model: no record, no mail, no wake.

    Three things have to hold, and the third is what makes the first two safe
    to ship — a fix that simply stopped reaping would trade a killed subagent
    for an immortal wedged process."""

        ⚠ This check used to read `"SUBAGENT DIED" in mail_log and not mail`,
        and that was a hole a redteam mutant walked straight through: delete
        the PENDING-BOX write from `_bg_orphaned`, keep `mail_log` and the
        nudge, and it still passed — because "the box is empty" is satisfied
        just as well by "nothing was ever put in it" as by "it was queued and
        then delivered". The deleted half is the load-bearing one: the revive
        scan on a backend restart asks `Org.waking_mail(nid)`, which reads the
        PENDING box and never `mail_log`, so that mutant silently gave up
        surviving a deploy — one of the very ways the process dies.

        The transcript is the answer. `_message` renders each mail's body
        verbatim into the next turn's prompt, so the marker reaching a fake
        CLI's transcript proves the whole chain end to end: queued in the
        pending box → the node was driven → delivery drained the box into a
        real turn. Note the nudge `_bg_orphaned` sends does NOT contain this
        marker, which is exactly what makes it discriminating: a wake with no
        mail behind it can no longer pass.

        ⚠ It must be THIS org's notice. `transcript_text()` greps every fake
        CLI's transcript in the whole rig, and an earlier draft argued a bare
        "SUBAGENT DIED" grep was safe because check 2 had already ruled the
        healthy org out. That argument was wrong twice over (redteam,
        2026-08-21): check 2's guard runs AFTER its own `wait_delivered`, so a
        regression in the bg exemption makes check 2 raise before the guard
        ever executes — and the healthy org really does emit notices then
        (measured: 9 occurrences in its transcript with `_dog` reverted to
        TURN_IDLE, amplified by each notice driving a follow-up turn and by
        every later `start_backend` re-driving the boxed mail through
        `reconcile`'s revive scan). So key on a task id, which the stand-in
        salts per process (`bgtask<i>_<hex>`) and which therefore cannot come

    """USER REPORT 2026-08-19: "I/O operation on closed file" appears at an
    agent's turn end, and the agent has undelivered mail from a subordinate.

    The mechanism: orgtree closes the CLI's stdin at a result boundary that
    finds the queue empty. A SECOND result event for the same turn (the CLI
    has out-of-band result paths — the stream-json writer's own
    error_during_execution, error_max_turns) then re-enters the boundary
    branch; if anything was queued in the interval, it is fed down the closed
    pipe. `TextIOWrapper.write` raises `ValueError: I/O operation on closed
    file.`, NOT the OSError the branch caught — so it escaped to the turn's
    catch-all, became that cryptic banner, and took the in-memory carrier with
    it, folding the drained mail back into the mailbox undelivered. The mail
    is not lost (§ the at-least-once invariant holds) but it stops moving:
    exactly "an unreceived mail from one of its subordinates".

    And the deeper half, which the first version of this check MISSED: the
    straggler is a TOP-LEVEL result, so it also clobbered `res`. Carrying the
    CLI's real `is_error: true`, that turned a SUCCESSFUL, paid turn into
    `turn failed: …` — `_after_turn` never ran, so its `total_cost_usd` was
    never booked, no `turns` ring entry, and a permanent turn_error_log row on
    a turn that worked (redteam 2026-08-19 measured 0 turns booked, costs []).
    Hence `stdin_open`: the closed pipe is what tells a boundary from a
    straggler, because the boundary is what closed it.

    happened — `send()` must report the message QUEUED (not steered), or the
