"""One command that runs every test in the repo, and keeps them from rotting.

    python tools/run_tests.py               # fast tier  (~2 min, hermetic)
    python tools/run_tests.py --full        # everything (~13 min)
    python tools/run_tests.py --list        # show the plan, run nothing

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Seven backend suites and one frontend suite, each a plain runnable script with
its own flags, its own port, its own throwaway `ORGTREE_DATA`, and no pytest.
Nobody remembers seven invocations, so in practice nobody ran them — and two of
those suites carry DRIFT GUARDS (`msgvis.py` greps four source files for nine
mirrored expressions; `derived.test.ts` pins seven constants). A drift guard
that is never run protects nothing. This runner exists so that "run the tests"
is one command, and so that a drift failure is legible as *drift* rather than
as some unrelated red line in the middle of 1,100 checks.

WHERE IT LIVES AND WHY
----------------------
`tools/`, next to `disk_drill.py` / `ui_probe.py` / `social_preview.py` — the
repo's existing home for operator scripts that are not part of the shipped
package. It has to sit above both `backend/` and `frontend/` because it drives
both, so neither of those is a candidate; the repo root is reserved for the
handful of top-level entry points (`update.sh`).

HOW SUITES ARE FOUND — nothing is hardcoded
-------------------------------------------
Backend suites are `backend/tests/test_*.py`, by glob. The frontend suite is
`frontend/tests/run.mjs` if it is there. A suite that does not exist yet is
simply absent; a suite added tomorrow is picked up with no edit here. Each
suite's own source is then read to work out how to run it:

  * FLAGS — every `"--word"` literal in the file. A suite that offers
    `--hermetic` is run that way in the fast tier; failing that, `--quick`;
    failing that, plain. The suite's own advertised reduction is respected
    rather than guessed at.
  * EXCLUSIVE — a suite that names `uvicorn`, sets an `ORGTREE_*PORT`, or
    shells out to `"docker"` without offering a `--docker` opt-in starts a real
    listener or a real container. Two of those at once collide on a fixed port
    and, worse, compete for CPU with each other's timing assertions. They are
    run one at a time, after the parallel pool has drained, so nothing is
    racing them. ⚠ Assigning each one a free port instead was considered and
    rejected: most of them fix their port by writing `ORGTREE_PORT` at import
    time, before argv is looked at, so there is nothing to assign — and the
    port was never the whole hazard anyway. The live rigs assert timing, and a
    suite measuring a ~1 s race while three others saturate the CPU is a suite
    that fails for the wrong reason.
  * DRIFT GUARD — the suite, or a helper module it imports out of the tests
    directory, mentions a source-contract check. Its verdict is then hunted for
    in the output and reported separately from the pass/fail count.

Opt-IN modes are never driven from here: `--docker`, `--real-cli`,
`--discriminate`, `--legacy-client`. Each needs something the runner cannot
promise (a daemon, a paid model, a mutated copy of the package) or deliberately
measures pre-fix behaviour. Run those by hand from the suite's own docstring.

`SLOW` below is the one table of literals, and it is deliberately NOT a list of
suites: it is a list of *measured* wall times that disqualify a suite from the
fast tier even in its cheapest advertised mode. An entry naming a file that no
longer exists is ignored. A suite missing from it is included in the fast tier.

SAFETY
------
`:7360` and the live orgs are the operator's running deployment. The runner
refuses to start a suite whose source names that port, strips every `ORGTREE_*`
variable out of the child environment (except the frontend runner's own
`ORGTREE_TEST_*` knobs, none of which names a data root) so no suite can
inherit a pointer at the real data directory, and never assigns a port itself.

HERMETIC HOME
-------------
Every suite runs with `HOME` pointed at a throwaway directory and a stub `bin/`
first on `PATH`, built once per run by `hermetic_home()`:

  * `~/.claude.json` names a fixture account (`tests@example.invalid`) and
    `~/.codex/auth.json` holds a fake API key — metadata only, no credential.
  * `bin/claude` and `bin/codex` answer `--version` and exit 97 on anything
    else, so a suite that reaches for a real CLI fails loudly instead of
    billing a model. Suites that need a behaving CLI point `ORGTREE_CLAUDE*` /
    `ORGTREE_CODEX` at their own fakes, as they always have.
  * `CODEX_HOME`, `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` are unset; git
    identity comes from `GIT_AUTHOR_*` / `GIT_COMMITTER_*`; `PYTHONUSERBASE`
    keeps the real user-site packages importable.
  * `ORGTREE_TEST_REAL_HOME` names the real home, so live-root guards
    (`_no_deploy.assert_isolated_data_root`) still refuse the operator's real
    `~/orgtree`.
  * `ORGTREE_TEST_STUB_BIN` names the stub directory, so a suite with a
    real-CLI leg (`test_codex_mcp_approval.py`) skips it instead of failing
    on the stub.

So every machine — a signed-in dev box, a bare CI runner — presents the same
host state to the provider hire gates, and a suite's result does not depend on
who is logged in where it runs. A suite that sets its own `HOME` wins.

DID IT FINISH? — the one question this runner used to be unable to answer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
A run that is KILLED part-way is otherwise indistinguishable from a run that
passed: the last thing on stdout is a column of `✓` lines, stderr is empty,
and there is no marker of any kind. Measured 2026-08-26 — two tier runs died
at 49 s and 36 s having completed 19 and 25 suites with ZERO failures between
them, and the only record of a cause anyone wrote down was "a background
teardown". A deploy was gated on one of those runs.

So the last two things this runner does, and it does them together, are:

  * print `RUN COMPLETE  suites=N/M  …  rc=X` as the final stdout line, and
  * write a `COMPLETE` file into `logdir`.

Their ABSENCE is the signal. Neither can be produced by a run that died early,
because nothing writes them until every suite has been accounted for. The
summary bar above them is not enough on its own — it is prose, and a reader
skims it — while `RUN COMPLETE` is one grep and `COMPLETE` is one
`os.path.exists`. Gate on those, never on "I did not see a ✗".

⚠ The stdout line is printed BEFORE the marker file is written, and that order
is deliberate. Any interruption between them then leaves a run looking
UNFINISHED, never finished — the safe direction. Reversed, a truncated log
would carry a marker asserting a completeness it cannot back up, and a marker
that lies is worse than no marker: it turns "I cannot tell" into "I was told
wrong".

Retroactively, on a run whose stdout is long gone: the plan header prints
`plan · N to run`, and `run_one` writes a suite's log only once that suite has
FINISHED — so `ls <logdir> | wc -l` against N tells you how far a past run
actually got. That one works on every run already on disk.

`backend/tests/test_run_completion.py` is the acceptance suite, and it earns
its keep by killing a real run mid-flight rather than by reasoning about this
docstring.

    ⚠ THIS ASKS WHETHER THE PROCESS DIED, NOT WHETHER A PHRASE IS MISSING,
    and the difference is the whole design. The first version of this fix
    flagged "no recognised final total" — an open-ended absence — and a full
    sweep immediately branded two suites that had run to completion:
    `account-pool-state` ends "1 of 39 checks FAILED" and `codex-prewarm`
    ends "1 FAILED, 6 PASSED", neither of which matched the phrase list. A
    flag that cries wolf is worthless within a day, so chasing summary
    formats one at a time was the wrong shape: there is no closed set of them.
    There IS a closed set of ways a run dies.

    So: find the LAST traceback, and ask whether anything after it reports
    counts. A suite that caught its failures prints its summary after the
    traceback it echoed; a suite that died has nothing after it. A suite that
    never raised at all is not a candidate.

    Lifted out of `run_one` and given only the output text, so it can be
    exercised without a subprocess and so an exit code cannot creep back into
    the decision — that gate is what hid four dark tails for up to 25 days.
