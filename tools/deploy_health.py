"""Post-deploy health check: did the backend come up carrying the state it is
supposed to have?

WHY THIS EXISTS.  The deploy script used to end by asking `/api/orgs` for an HTTP
200 and calling that healthy.  **An empty list is a perfectly good 200.**  So
this sequence reported success: the SQLite cutover ships, someone rolls the
code back without migrating the data back, the backend starts fine against a
migrated root, presents ZERO orgs -- and the deploy script blesses it.  The
whole install appears to have vanished while every automated signal says green.
The storage layer refuses that particular mismatch loudly now, but "it
answered" was never a statement about state, and any number of other faults
land in the same place.

WHAT "EXPECTED" MEANS, AND WHY IT IS A FILESYSTEM SCAN.
The expectation is derived from the data root's own contents: a slug is
expected if `orgs/` holds ANY of `<slug>.json`, `<slug>.db` or
`<slug>.json.premigration*`.

  * NOT a hardcoded list -- that would be wrong on every machine but one.
  * NOT `store.list_orgs()`.  That is the most tempting option and it is the
    trap: under the rollback above, the deployed JSON build looks for
    `<slug>.json`, finds only `<slug>.db` + `<slug>.json.premigration`, and
    honestly reports zero.  A check that asks the code under test what to
    expect agrees with the bug.  So this module imports NOTHING from orgtree
    and reads only the stdlib -- it is a genuine second source of truth, which
    docs/test-baseline.md notes is the only thing that catches an instrument
    that never contradicts itself.
  * The union of the three suffixes is deliberately BACKEND-AGNOSTIC.  Under
    JSON the live document is `<slug>.json`; under SQLite it is `<slug>.db`
    with the pre-cutover copy parked at `<slug>.json.premigration`.  An org
    caught mid-migration has the premigration and no `.json` at all.  In every
    one of those states the org EXISTS and a healthy backend must serve it.
  * `delete_org` moves every one of an org's files -- premigration included --
    into `deleted/`, so `orgs/` holds live orgs only and a deleted org does
    not haunt the expectation.

THE FAILURE MODES THIS IS SHAPED AROUND.

  * **"I could not tell" is not "healthy."**  If the expectation cannot be
    determined the check FAILS (exit 3).  It never falls back to passing.
  * **A legitimately empty install is a real state.**  A data root with no
    `orgs/` directory -- a machine on its first-ever deploy -- expects zero
    orgs and passes when it serves zero.  It does not fail forever.
  * **"Not up yet" and "up and wrong" are different answers**, and the check
    reports them as different verdicts (exit 2 vs exit 1) because the operator
    does entirely different things about them.
  * **It must not hang the deploy.**  Two bounded budgets, never one open
    wait: `--up-deadline` for the first 200, then `--state-deadline` for the
    state to settle.  The worst case is their sum, always.
  * **It must not cry wolf.**  The state comparison RETRIES for the whole
    second budget and passes the moment it matches, so a backend that answers
    before it has finished loading costs nothing.  And the pre-restart served
    set is captured as diagnostic context ONLY -- a machine that was already
    in a strange state before this deploy is not failed for it here.

USAGE (see update.sh section 5):

    python tools/deploy_health.py snapshot --data ROOT --port P --out FILE
    python tools/deploy_health.py verify  --port P --state FILE

`snapshot` runs BEFORE the backend is stopped: it works out the expectation
while the old process is still there to be asked, and records both.  `verify`
runs after the new one is started.  Splitting them is not decoration -- it
means an unreadable data root is reported before anything is killed, and it
gives the failure message the one sentence that makes it actionable ("the old
backend served the same three; this one serves none").
