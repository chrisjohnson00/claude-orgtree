"""Will the backend this deploy is about to start actually START on this root?

    python tools/preflight_store.py --data <root> [--repo <checkout>]

WHY THIS EXISTS.  main defaults to `ORGTREE_STORE=sqlite` (2026-09-04).  An
install that was running the JSON format and pulls main gets a backend that
REFUSES TO START (`MigrationRefused`) against its own data root — and if that
install registered the autostart tasks, `orgtree-ensure` relaunches the refusing
build every five minutes forever.  A routine `git pull` becomes a permanent
outage.  This script is what the deploy scripts ask BEFORE they stop anything,
so the deploy can do something about it instead of discovering it afterwards.

USER RULING 2026-09-04 17:00Z/17:02Z: SQLite is the canonical backend, JSON is
deprecated and past LTS, and an existing JSON install must be migrated
AUTOMATICALLY the moment it updates — no prompt, no flag, no manual step.  So
this script's job is NOT to refuse the deploy.  It is to tell the deploy which
of five situations it is in, and the deploy migrates.

    exit 0   PROCEED   the backend will start: the root and the build agree
    exit 1   MIGRATE   unmigrated JSON documents and a SQLite build.  This is
                       the upgrade case.  The deploy runs the cutover.
    exit 2   MIXED     both .db and .json in orgs/.  NEITHER backend starts, by
                       design.  Stop; this needs a human.
    exit 3   MISMATCH  .db documents and a JSON-pinned build (`BackendMismatch`).
                       Stop; the fix is to stop pinning JSON, not to convert.
    exit 4   UNKNOWN   could not determine.  ⚠ The deploy PROCEEDS on this, on
                       purpose — see "WHY UNKNOWN IS NOT A REFUSAL" below.

WHAT ACTUALLY DECIDES, and therefore what this pins itself to.  Not a comment,
not the runbook, and not a filename convention retyped here: `store.py`'s own
`STORE_BACKEND`, `pending_migrations()` and `active_databases()` — the three
expressions `claim_data_root` consults to decide whether to raise.  This script
imports the store out of the checkout being deployed and asks those three.  If
they change, this changes with them.

WHY UNKNOWN IS NOT A REFUSAL.  The authoritative answer needs `orgtree.store`
to import, and its chain reaches `schema.py` → `typing_extensions`, a
third-party dependency.  On the deploy path this script runs BEFORE
`pip install -r requirements.txt`, so a checkout whose dependencies have moved
can fail to import for a reason that the deploy itself is about to fix.
Refusing there would be a guard a normal, correct deploy trips — worse than no
guard.  So the import failure falls back to a degraded read (the store default
parsed out of `store.py`'s source with `ast`, plus a plain listdir of `orgs/`),
which is reported as UNKNOWN with its best guess printed in full, and never
stops a deploy.  The residual is stated rather than hidden: on a checkout that
cannot import its own store, an unmigrated root gets a loud warning and the old
behaviour, not an automatic migration.

NOTHING HERE WRITES.  `ORGTREE_DATA` is pointed at a throwaway directory before
the store is imported and the target root is passed explicitly to every call,
which is the documented "claimed only — never migrated, never refused for JSON"
path.  A pre-flight that could convert something is a pre-flight nobody could
safely run.
