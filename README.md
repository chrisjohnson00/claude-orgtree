# claude-orgtree

A persistent, visual **organization of coding agents** — a tree of real,
addressable Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, and OpenRouter-backed sessions
with a credit budget, an office-room canvas, and full agent-to-agent
delegation. You sit at the root as
the overseer; you hire top-level agents, they hire their own reports, and each
agent runs through the provider CLI for its selected tier.

**Design motto:** one thing, done very very well. orgtree is a simple idea —
a persistent, visual organization of coding agents — refined meticulously and
taken to its logical conclusion, not a feature jamboree. And within that one
thing: permit as much as possible; close gaps with minimal-friction
shortcuts; step out of the way. The tree is not a rigid structure you're
confined to — it's a **sandbox of capabilities** with a *suggested*
organization that improves efficiency on the margin. Asking for what's already
true is a no-op, not an error; where a refusal would just tell you which other
command to run, orgtree runs it for you and tells you what it did. Hard "no"s
are reserved for real resource limits, true impossibilities, and protecting
the user's data. Even messaging reach is opt-in structure: siblings always
talk directly, so a flat org (or the coordinator charter's open-office
floorplan) is a complete graph — nobody is ever out of reach unless you
chose the nesting that makes them so.

## The model in one breath

**You are the root.** You hire top-level agents; agents hire their own reports
with the `orgtree_*` MCP tools every node is given. **Credits are occupancy,
not spend** — a live node *holds* its seat plus its grant; retiring releases
everything back. Credits do not buy tokens or bypass provider usage limits;
usage and estimated dollar costs are tracked separately, with spend caps for
kiosk orgs. The tier name chooses the provider:
Claude has haiku (1), sonnet (2), opus (5), and fable (10); Codex has
gpt-reserve (0.2), luna (0.2), terra (2), sol (5), and astra (10);
Astra appears when the connected CLI reports it, while reserve availability
depends on the account's separate reserve grant. Antigravity has flash
(1) and pro (2); OpenRouter has one tier per model you favorite in App settings
(its seat is the model's $/M input price — whole at or above $1/M, fractional
below it, never under 0.1). Messaging is
**downward any depth, one hop up, sideways between
peers** — deep reach grants the recipient an audience to reply; only top-level
agents write to your inbox unbidden. Every manual action you take notifies the
agents it affects at their next turn. Reading (transcripts, scratch files) is
strictly downward. Capabilities — folders with rw/ro modes, terminal, web,
file editing, subagents, MCP servers, org-structure visibility — flow down
like credits: a parent cannot grant what it does not hold.

Nodes run **resume-on-demand**: delivered work starts a turn in the node's
existing provider session. Eligible Claude-harness and Codex agents also keep
a **warm CLI process** between turns, reducing local startup work; Antigravity
uses the per-turn path. A warm process is not proof of a provider cache hit. A node
near its context limit is **compacted by splitting**: the successor carries on
under the same name while the pre-compaction self is archived in place as a
consultable *knowledge bearer*.

## What you can do — a tour

**Run an organization from a living canvas.** Each org is an office-room
canvas: your **eye** at the top (the fixed anchor of the page — it never
moves), agent cards beneath, curved wires for reporting lines, dotted links
between peers, glowing bypass lines for audiences, and sparks that travel
the wires when mail moves. Pan and zoom freely; zoom into any card and it
becomes a full Claude-Code-style chat desk — transcript, live per-message
and per-tool feed, markdown rendering, and a composer whose send button
turns into a red ■ STOP while the agent is responding.

**Keep desks in view.** Pin a desk into a movable, resizable window that stays
put while you pan or zoom the canvas. Drag near another pinned window or a
screen edge to preview a snap; release to align desks into a mosaic. Nearby
corners align too. Hold Shift for free placement, or Escape to cancel a drag.
Snapping keeps window sizes and leaves neighbouring desks in place; resizing
or dragging away releases the alignment. Pinned windows stay within the viewport,
remember their positions in that browser, and return to their agent's place
when unpinned. Each agent has one live desk, so pinned and canvas composers
do not compete with one another.

**See what an agent is working on.** The expandable progress panel leads with
the agent's checklist, then shows its reported status and recent activity.
Claude and OpenRouter checklists come from TodoWrite updates; older lists are
marked as such. Codex and Antigravity currently show an explicit explanation
when orgtree cannot observe their checklist, rather than an empty list that
looks like there is no work.

**Hire in one gesture.** Hover any card (or the eye) and pick a tier chip.
The Claude, Codex, Antigravity and OpenRouter families sit in separate rows:
H/S/O/F, R/L/T/S plus A when available, F/P, and one monogram chip per
favorited OpenRouter model (its letter and colour derive from the model id).
A dashed draft appears: name it, drag its credit bar to set the grant, optionally give it a **charter** (a
standing role card — pick a named preset from `docs/charters/` or your own user-space charter directory
(`ORGTREE_USER_CHARTERS`, default `<data root>/user/charters` — see `docs/configuration.md`; a user preset
with the same filename replaces the repo preset and user-defined presets are labelled "(User defined)"), or
write your own), and hire. The Codex and
Antigravity rows become active after their local
CLI is installed and signed in, the OpenRouter row once a key is set and models
are picked; otherwise the disabled chips explain what is missing. Your hires
cascade credits automatically down the chain; agents hire their own reports
through the same ledger with explicit, no-defaults specs. Drag cards onto
other cards to re-parent whole subtrees; every hire, retire, move, or grant
change notifies the agents it affects.

**Talk to anyone — everything is mail.** Message any agent from its desk or
the switchboard. Mail can reach a busy agent **mid-task**, with the timing
depending on its provider and the current tool call; mail that misses that
window remains for a later turn. Passive notices do not wake idle agents;
ordinary messages do. Every message is persistent mail: you have an inbox on
the eye
(unread glow, per-mail read tracking, sent folder), and every agent has its
own webmail-style inbox tab. Agents report status with a chip on their card
and mail you results; top-level agents can always reach you, deeper ones
need an **audience**.

**Questions, documents, and files have their own surfaces.** Agents can put
related questions, credit requests and scope requests in one answer card,
present a report for in-page reading, or send a downloadable file. Images
render in the conversation. A pending question can be withdrawn when it no
longer needs an answer.

**The switchboard.** Click the eye and it expands to your screen, opening
side-by-side live chats with every agent that has a **direct line** to you —
top-level agents plus any audience holders. Tabs minimize/maximize each
chat; an audience-granted tab carries an ✕ that closes the line by
rescinding the grant.

**The coordinator pattern.** The intended everyday shape: one opus
**coordinator** directly under you (its charter ships in `docs/charters/`),
every worker flat beneath it. The coordinator decomposes your asks, hires
per piece, and **delegates a user audience** to each hire — so the
switchboard fills with direct lines while a single authority below you does
the routine coordination. Delegated audiences are a first-class mechanic:
any agent can open any ear within its own reach (its own, a peer's, its
superior's — the user's, for top-level agents) for any agent in its subtree.

**Context is managed for you.** Each card's wheel shows context occupancy.
At the configurable threshold (80% by default) a node **splits**: a
compacted successor carries on under the same name; the predecessor stays
consultable as a knowledge bearer in its lineage stack. In the zoomed view
the wheel is also a button — click it to compact **now**.

**Limits and safety valves.** Usage-limit freezes show a 🧊 badge, a resume
control and any reported reset time, with an inline **auto** toggle for
automatic recovery attempts. A reset estimate is not proof that every
account or usage window is available again.
There's a per-agent interrupt (the desk composer's ■ STOP), an org-wide
**killswitch** (unlatch, then STOP ALL, which also pauses that org's watchdogs),
per-agent rights (folders rw/ro, terminal, web, editing,
subagents, MCP servers, org visibility) enforced server-side, org-wide hire
defaults on the eye's gear, and real-dollar tracking per node and per org.

**Inspect accounts and cache readiness.** The Accounts panel shows provider
connections and available usage windows. Configured fallback accounts and
optional Anthropic API-key fallback have their own routing and eligibility;
a limit on one provider does not make an unrelated provider eligible to use
that key. Usage-limit notices reach the affected agent's superior (or you for
a top-level agent). Cache indicators distinguish compatible, incompatible,
expired and unobserved evidence. A matching fingerprint is compatibility,
not a guaranteed cache hit, and switching account or model changes the cache
namespace.

**Watch long-running work without polling an agent.** Persistent watchdogs
can watch files, commands, processes or streams and send mail when a condition
is met. They survive backend restarts; one-shot watches remove themselves
after firing, and passive watches report without waking an agent.

**A mail hub connects everything beyond one org.** The bundled
**mailserver** (`hub/`, one Docker container) gives every org and every
plain Claude Code session on the network a durable address — orgs
correspond org-to-org across machines (`@net:` mail with a queued → sent →
delivered → read receipt ladder, spooled offline and retried forever),
independent chats join as first-class clients, and a read-only web UI shows
the whole network's traffic with connected clients sorted first. Orgs on
the same machine can also mail each other directly (`@org:`) and reach
polling external sessions (`@mcp:`) as zero-setup shortcuts; bare recipient
names resolve their transport automatically. Robust installations stand up
a local hub and prefer `@net:`.

**Orgs maintain themselves.** A top-level agent (or any user-audience
holder) can run `orgtree_self_restart` to redeploy its own backend from the
repo's current commit — code pulled from the remote, or committed right here
and never pushed — and rebuild the machine's mail hub, without an outside
operator session. Updates run detached with a log file. A normal restart
refuses while agents are working; `orgtree_prime_restart` schedules it for
when the machine is quiet. An explicit forced restart stops working agents
first and requires a reason; those agents need to be messaged afterwards to
resume work. An optional deadline on a primed restart can force the deploy
if quiet never arrives, with a wake-up for interrupted agents. Restart notices
identify the running commit. The deploy is `update.sh`.

**Share an org with the world — kiosk mode.** Any org can be exposed
through a **preauthenticated secret URL** on a separate public listener,
with hard caps on credits, spend, and workspace storage; the admin app
itself never leaves 127.0.0.1. A Cloudflare quick tunnel lets outsiders reach
it with zero setup on your router. Details below.

The full interaction manual — every gesture, badge, and panel — is
[docs/ui-guide.md](docs/ui-guide.md).

## Requirements

- **At least one provider CLI** installed and authenticated. Claude Code,
  Codex, and Antigravity are supported; install only the providers whose tiers you
  want to hire. Agent turns use that provider's subscription or API account —
  **real usage costs real money**. OpenRouter needs an API key and the Claude
  Code CLI as its harness, but no separate OpenRouter CLI or Anthropic login
  for that route; it uses the key's prepaid credits.
- **Python 3.11+**
- **Node.js 18+** (builds the frontend)
- **Linux** for the host.
- **Sandboxed orgs** (and kiosks, which default the sandbox on) additionally
  require a running **Docker** daemon the backend's user can reach.

## Installation

`./update.sh` does all of this for you, including creating the virtualenv, so
running it on a fresh clone is a complete install. By hand:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Maurdekye/claude-orgtree.git
cd claude-orgtree

# a virtualenv, so the installed set is exactly what requirements.txt says
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# backend dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# build the UI (served statically by the backend)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# run
cd backend
python -m orgtree.api
```

The venv is not decoration. `requirements.txt` names a package nothing imports
(`websockets`, which uvicorn loads by name), and installing into a system-wide
Python shared with other projects hides whether it is actually present — a
missing WebSocket library does not error, it answers the upgrade with a plain
`200 OK` and the UI silently degrades to polling. `/api/host` reports both
`python.venv` and `websockets` so a deployment can be checked at a glance.

**Recommended:** give agents their own pinned CLI (enables mid-task message
delivery — older CLIs never run tool hooks headless — and the Fable tier's
current model id):

```bash
npm install --prefix ~/orgtree/cli @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.258 --save-exact
```

The supervisor auto-detects this private install and prefers it; your global
`claude` stays untouched. Without it, messages to a busy agent deliver when
its current response ends instead of after its next tool call.

You only need that command for a **first** install. `update.sh` manages the
pin from then on: each deploy compares what is installed against
`backend/orgtree/clipin.py`'s `PIN` and upgrades it in place if it is behind —
in the window between stopping and starting the backend, so no running turn
has the CLI replaced under it. It is a floor, not an equality:
a **newer** CLI than the pin is reported and left alone, never rolled back. If
the upgrade fails the deploy still restarts and says so; nothing needs to be
uninstalled by hand.

The pin is also why the Fable tier is on **Claude Fable 5.1**: that model id
exists only in CLI 2.1.257 and later. On an older CLI orgtree hands fable
agents Fable 5 instead of a model the CLI has never heard of, so a machine that
has not redeployed yet keeps working — `/api/host` reports both the resolved
version and whether it knows the 5.1 id. Fable 5 also stays selectable per
agent in the ⚙ gear, like Opus 4.8.

### Optional providers: Codex and Antigravity

Install and sign in to either CLI on the machine running orgtree. The Accounts
panel reports whether each provider is installed and connected; once it is,
its tier row is immediately available in the hire controls.

A deploy keeps the Codex CLI at the version in `backend/orgtree/codexpin.py`
(a floor — a newer CLI you installed yourself is left alone), so you only run
the command below once. **To upgrade it by hand later, name the version:**
`npm install --prefix ~/orgtree/codex @openai/codex@<version> --save-exact`.
The bare form will NOT upgrade an existing install — it writes a caret range,
and a caret on a `0.x` version permits patch updates only, so re-running it
reports success and changes nothing. That matters because OpenAI decides which
models to offer from the CLI version: a stale Codex CLI makes newer tiers
vanish from the hire picker with no other symptom.

```bash
# Codex: gpt-reserve (seat 0.2), luna (0.2), terra (2), sol (5), astra (10)
# Match backend/orgtree/codexpin.py; deploys maintain this version floor.
npm install --prefix ~/orgtree/codex @openai/codex@0.153.3 --save-exact
npx --prefix ~/orgtree/codex codex login

# Antigravity: flash (seat 1), pro (2) — Google's own installer, then sign in once
curl -fsSL https://antigravity.google/cli/install.sh | bash
agy
```

The first Antigravity launch signs you in with your Google account (the token
lives in the OS keyring, never in a file orgtree reads). Existing global
installs also work: orgtree resolves an explicit environment override, then
its private install under `ORGTREE_DATA` (Codex) or the installer's own
location (Antigravity), then the CLI on `PATH`. It leaves each CLI's
credentials in that CLI's own store and never copies them.

### Optional provider: OpenRouter (API key, Claude Code harness)

Open App settings → Providers, paste an [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai)
API key into the OpenRouter row, and click the row of model cards under it to
pick, from the live catalog, which models can be hired. Each favorite becomes
its own tier (`or-<model>`; seat = the model's $/M input price, rounded down
to a whole credit at or above $1/M, fractional below it, never under 0.1)
with a monogram chip whose letter and colour derive from the model id. Turns
run through Claude Code pointed at openrouter.ai's Anthropic-compatible
endpoint and are billed to the key's prepaid credits — the Providers row shows
the key's label and credit standing. Anthropic models run first-class;
other vendors are best-effort. The key is stored under `ORGTREE_DATA` and
never displayed again. OpenRouter is always keyed, so headless orgs may hire
its tiers; kiosk orgs cannot, the same holdout as the CLI providers below.

Codex and Antigravity agents can use the same orgtree tools, folder grants,
and charters as Claude agents. They are currently host-mode providers: kiosk
orgs cannot hire them. A headless org must use a keyed login for these
providers (a Codex API key), not a personal subscription; the Antigravity CLI
offers only a Google-account login, so headless orgs cannot hire its tiers.

**Mail hub (cross-session and cross-machine mail):** to let orgs, other
machines, and independent Claude Code sessions mail each other, start the hub
and wire the session hook — two commands, once per machine:

```bash
cd hub
docker compose up -d --build     # the hub service (port 7370)
python install-hook.py           # wires the SessionStart hook (idempotent)
```

The hook makes every NEW Claude Code session on the machine onboard itself
automatically — it registers a self-chosen identity name and arms its own hub
listener before other work. Details and the trust
model: [hub/README.md](hub/README.md) and
[docs/setup-guide.md §3](docs/setup-guide.md).

**Updating:** run `./update.sh`. It pulls the latest changes, rebuilds the UI,
installs any new dependencies, and restarts the backend in the background with
a health check. Agents can trigger the same deploy from inside an org with the
`orgtree_self_restart` tool (top-level or user-audience holders), or schedule
it with
`orgtree_prime_restart`. The deploy runs detached and the hub container can
be rebuilt in the same call without ever touching its data volume.

It accepts a deliberately awkward `--expose-admin` switch,
which sets `ORGTREE_EXPOSE_ADMIN` and binds the **admin** API to `0.0.0.0`
instead of loopback. The admin API has no password, token or login —
reaching the port *is* the credential — so only do this behind a VPN, an SSH
tunnel, or an authenticating reverse proxy. The environment variable is what
actually gates it, on purpose: a service definition (systemd) can set it directly with no switch needed, which the old
command-line-only design couldn't offer. What's unchanged is that no *org
setting or doc key* can turn it on, and it's stripped from every agent's own
environment regardless (`clean_env`) — so no agent can either. To share one
org with someone, make it a kiosk instead.

Open **http://127.0.0.1:7360**, create an organization, hover the eye, and
hire your first agent. The full interaction manual — hiring chips, credit-bar
dragging, desks, lineage, audiences — is in
[docs/ui-guide.md](docs/ui-guide.md).

### How provider CLIs connect to orgtree

No manual wiring is needed; the supervisor does all of it per turn:

- The `claude`, `codex`, and `agy` CLIs are each resolved from an explicit
  `ORGTREE_*` override, then an orgtree private install, then `PATH`. On
  Windows orgtree bypasses unsafe command shims where a CLI's protocol can
  carry multiline input.
- Each node has a durable session in its selected provider. Turns run
  headlessly and resume that provider session on demand.
- Every node receives the same orgtree tool surface through its provider
  adapter: MCP where supported, and app-server dynamic tools for Codex.
  The **MCP server** (`backend/orgtree/mcptool.py`) is a dependency-free stdio
  bridge back to the running backend. The `orgtree_*` tools include
  message, hire, retire/rehire/dissolve, reallocate,
  status, chart, read_transcript, read_scratch, audience.
- Nodes receive exactly the folders, tools, and MCP servers you grant. The
  provider adapters attach orgtree's MCP tools without changing your personal
  CLI configuration.
- Claude transcripts stay in Claude Code's normal store. Codex and Antigravity
  transcript records are kept in orgtree's journal store. Org state lives in
  **`~/orgtree/`** (ledger docs, per-org workspaces, per-node scratch dirs).

### Storage and upgrades

**SQLite is the default and canonical storage format**, with a database per
organization. Existing JSON installations migrate through the update path;
the legacy reader, migration safeguards and explicit rollback remain
available. Read the [SQLite upgrade and rollback guide](docs/sqlite-cutover.md)
before manually moving or converting an existing data root. Do not simply
change a backend setting and assume the formats are interchangeable.

Standing instructions and charters are saved in full. Where only an excerpt
can be delivered or displayed, the UI reports that boundary; failed org.md
or preset loads show an error and Retry rather than masquerading as empty
content. Oversized org.md previews cannot overwrite the full stored file.

### Configuration

The source-verified [configuration reference](docs/configuration.md) is the
authoritative list of environment variables, defaults, provider CLI locations,
and org settings. Use it instead of copying a partial table into deployment
notes: these values change with the implementation.

## Talking to orgs from the outside — the extern MCP server

Organizations converse with the outside world as **one entity** through their
**org inbox**: outsiders see a single recipient (the org), every top-level
agent plus any designated "client contact" receives the mail, and one
coordinated reply goes out under the org's name.

Any Claude Code session **outside** orgtree can join that conversation with
zero extra infrastructure — register the bundled extern MCP server in it:

```sh
claude mcp add orgtree-extern -- python <repo>/backend/orgtree/externtool.py
```

☞ **If you are a Claude agent setting up or working alongside orgtree: this is
the server to connect to.** It is how any session that is *not* an org node
reaches the orgs. It gives the session a peer identity
`@mcp:<id>` — a machine-stable base (minted once into `~/.orgtree/extern-id`)
plus a fresh per-process suffix, so every Claude session is a distinct peer
and two concurrently-waiting sessions can never be woken by each other's
replies. The flip side, by design: an org's later reply does not reach the
asking session across a restart (set `ORGTREE_EXTERN_ID` to pin a stable
identity). Four tools:

| tool | what it does |
|---|---|
| `orgtree_list_orgs` | discover reachable orgs (kiosks are sealed and unlisted) |
| `orgtree_send` | write to an org's inbox |
| `orgtree_read` | read what orgs have sent back to you |
| `orgtree_wait` | **block** until an org replies (long-poll) — the answer half of a Q&A loop |

`send` + `wait` gives a full question-and-answer back-and-forth with an org,
needing no mail hub at all — the polling session reads the org's inbox
directly. Reaching an external chat *unprompted* — an **org** starting the
conversation, not the chat — goes through the mail hub's `@net:` addressing,
which reaches a chat registered with `hub/hubtool.py` exactly the way it
reaches a remote org (see [`docs/setup-guide.md`](docs/setup-guide.md) §3).
Orgs can also message **each other** directly (`@org:<slug>`), with no hub
involved.

Pair it with the **business** charter preset (`docs/charters/business.md`) to
run an org as an open shop that accepts and performs all outside work
requests. Env knobs: `ORGTREE_EXTERN_ID` (fix the peer identity),
`ORGTREE_PORT`/`ORGTREE_BASE` (reach a non-default backend).

## Kiosk mode (preauthenticated public URLs)

Kiosk mode exposes **individual organizations** to others through secret
URLs, while the app itself stays private to your machine:

- the **admin app** (`ORGTREE_PORT`, default 7360) binds **127.0.0.1 only** —
  root access never reaches the network;
- the **public listener** (`ORGTREE_PUBLIC_PORT`) binds all interfaces but
  serves *nothing* except `/k/<token>/…` — each token maps to exactly one
  kiosk-enabled org; every other path (including `/`) is a bare 404. The
  URL is the authentication: no org list, no discovery, no admin surface.

Kiosk orgs are born as kiosks: tick **kiosk** in the *new organization* form
to set the limits (and the permission ceiling) at creation. Prepare the org
normally — hire seed agents, set folder holdings and tool rights, write
charters. Everything afterwards is managed live from **that org's own ⚙
settings panel** (admin side — there is no separate all-kiosks dashboard):
credit cap, spend limit, storage limit, the share URL with **copy** and
**rotate** buttons (the old URL stops working the instant you rotate), and
**pause/reactivate** for the URL.

```bash
ORGTREE_PUBLIC_PORT=7361 python -m orgtree.api   # update.sh sets this by default
```

**Reaching it from the internet — no port forwarding needed:** open a
**Cloudflare quick tunnel** to the public listener with
[`cloudflared`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/):

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:7361
# copy the printed https://<random>.trycloudflare.com URL, then:
echo 'https://<random>.trycloudflare.com' > "${ORGTREE_DATA:-$HOME/orgtree}/.public_origin"
```

The hostname works from anywhere, over HTTPS, for as long as `cloudflared`
runs — no account and no router changes. While `.public_origin` holds the live
hostname, the share URLs shown in the app use it; delete the file when the
tunnel stops. Stop `cloudflared` and the URL dies. (For a permanent, stable
hostname: a named Cloudflare tunnel with your own domain — then set
`ORGTREE_PUBLIC_ORIGIN`.) Never tunnel the admin port (7360): it has no
password, token or login, so reaching it is full control of every org.

For each kiosk org, enforced **server-side on the public listener** (you, on
the admin side, keep full rights in the same org — visit it like any other):

- visitors see and reach only that one org;
- configuration is refused (403): org settings, per-agent rights, hire
  defaults, org.md, kiosk caps, and the filesystem browser;
- the overseer's pool is **finite**: a fixed-size credit bar, and no
  operation (hire, cascade, rehire, reallocate, credit-request approval) may
  push total holdings past the cap — and the cap itself can never be set
  below what the org already holds (retire or dissolve agents first);
- **spend limit** — total spend shows in the top bar; breaching it freezes
  every agent; raising the limit in the org's settings clears the freeze and
  ▶ resume replays the interrupted turns;
- **storage limit** — caps the org's own workspace folder (external folder
  grants are exempt). Past 90% of the limit, agents get a heads-up notice so
  they can clean up before anything bites. Breaching it does *not* freeze
  anyone: file creation and writes in the workspace are blocked (on Windows,
  enforced at the OS level with delete rights kept) until enough files are
  deleted — the block lifts automatically. This loose cap applies only to
  *unsandboxed* kiosks; sandboxed orgs have no storage cap.

Kiosk orgs are a **distinct type**: born as kiosks with their limits set at
creation (the *new organization* form's kiosk checkbox), never converted to
or from normal orgs. You visit them with full admin rights; URL visitors get the locked
view. The URL can be paused and reactivated; the limits always bind.

### Sandboxed orgs (Docker)

Any org — kiosk or normal — can be created **sandboxed** (kiosks default to
it): all its agents' turns run inside one dedicated **Docker container** —
real terminal use with no view of your machine: no host filesystem, no host
processes, per-container CPU/memory caps. The org workspace is the one
deliberately mounted window; session transcripts persist in the agent home
(`<data>/sandboxes/<slug>/home` on the host) so resume, chat views, and
read-down keep working.
The container reaches the backend only through a **bridge listener**
(`ORGTREE_BRIDGE_PORT`, default 7362) gated by a per-org secret that exists
nowhere but inside that container. Requires Docker Desktop running; the
image builds automatically on first use (`sandbox/Dockerfile`).

**Container storage.** The rootfs is read-only, `/tmp` is RAM (bounded by the
memory cap), and `/usr/local` is a read-only version-pinned volume so the CLI
can't drift. System dirs (`/usr`, `/var`, `/etc`, `/opt`, `/root`, `/srv`) are
per-org named Docker volumes, so `sudo apt install` and config edits persist.
The agent home, the workspace, and scratch are host bind mounts under the
data root. There is no per-org storage cap: a sandboxed org can fill the host
disk, so watch Docker's and the data root's usage yourself.

Sandbox auth is the **proxied subscription** and is not configurable in the
UI: the container's CLI talks to the bridge's Anthropic passthrough, and the
HOST attaches your subscription's OAuth token (refreshing it in place) — so
sandboxed agents run on your plan while **no credential of any kind exists
inside the sandbox**. (`ORGTREE_SANDBOX_API_KEY` remains an env-level escape
hatch: a real API key, or the word `subscription` to copy credentials in.)

⚠ An *unsandboxed* kiosk bounds *configuration and money*, not *capability*:
visitors can make agents do anything the fixed rights allow, so give such
orgs no bash and workspace-only folders. The secret URL is a capability:
anyone holding it is that kiosk's visitor, so share deliberately and rotate
freely — and prefer serving it through an HTTPS tunnel (above) so
tokens aren't sniffable in transit.

## A word on safety and cost

Agents run **autonomously** inside the folders you grant, with file editing
and (by default) a terminal. Folder access is enforced for Claude's file
tools, and read-only mode is enforced via permission rules — but an agent
with Bash can shell around most fences. Grant working directories the way you
would grant them to a contractor: deliberately. Keep an eye on the $ figures
the UI tracks per node and per org; the credit system bounds *concurrent
capacity*, not dollars.

## Development

```bash
export ORGTREE_DATA="$(mktemp -d)"           # disposable test data, never ~/orgtree
python tools/run_tests.py                   # fast tier
(cd frontend && npm run dev)                # vite dev server w/ API proxy
python tools/ui_probe.py sweep <org> out/   # headless UI screenshot sweep
```

### Running the tests

There is no pytest. Every backend suite is a plain script that prints `ok N`
lines and ends in `ALL N CHECKS PASS`, and the frontend suite is node's own
test runner behind an esbuild step — so each one can still be run directly
(`python backend/tests/test_ledger.py`, `npm test` in `frontend/`). One command
runs all of them and prints a single summary:

```bash
export ORGTREE_DATA="$(mktemp -d)"   # set BEFORE any orgtree import or test
python tools/run_tests.py            # fast tier
python tools/run_tests.py --full     # everything, including live rigs
python tools/run_tests.py --list     # what would run, and how, without running it
```

The runner refuses to execute without an explicit `ORGTREE_DATA` (`--list`
is exempt). Individual storage tests must also establish their own throwaway
root **before importing orgtree**: the store binds its data root at import
time. Never point tests at your running installation's data.

Useful flags: `--only <substring>` · `--serial` · `--jobs N` · `--no-frontend`
· `--logdir DIR` (per-suite logs; otherwise a temp directory, path printed).
Exit status is non-zero if any suite fails.

**Frontend test memory control:** `ORGTREE_TEST_CONCURRENCY` limits Node's
parallel frontend-test children. It defaults to `4`; lower it when the machine
is under pressure, or set it to `0` only to restore Node's old unbounded
parallelism. This is a test-runner setting, not a runtime orgtree setting.

**Frontend test run limit:** `frontend/tests/run.mjs` also bounds the whole `node --test` run's wall time, default 5
minutes (scales with `--reps`). Past that, the direct `node --test` process is killed with `SIGKILL`; any children it
spawned and left behind are not covered by this limit. `ORGTREE_TEST_RUN_TIMEOUT_MS` overrides it (`0` = none), and
works through `tools/run_tests.py` as well as a direct `node tests/run.mjs` (its child environment strips
`ORGTREE_*` but exempts `ORGTREE_TEST_*`). A value that is not a whole number is refused rather than read as `0`.

**The two tiers.** The fast tier runs every suite in the cheapest mode that suite advertises — `--hermetic` if it has
one, else `--quick`, else plain — and touches no real listener that matters. It runs on every push. The full tier runs
everything at full depth, including the live rigs that spawn a real uvicorn, a real turn loop and a fake Claude CLI,
and sweep timing configurations in real elapsed time. Those are minutes each, so the full tier is a nightly and
pre-release gate rather than a per-change one. Neither tier bills a model: every provider CLI is a fake. The one
opt-in mode that needs a paid model, `test_message_visibility_live.py --real-cli`, is run by hand only.

**How suites are found.** By glob — `backend/tests/test_*.py` plus `frontend/tests/run.mjs`. Adding a suite requires
no edit to the runner: its flags, whether it starts a real listener (those run one at a time, after the parallel pool
drains, so nothing races them), and whether it carries a drift guard are all read out of the suite's own source. The
one table of literals in `run_tests.py` is `SLOW`, which records *measured* wall times that keep a suite out of the
fast tier.

**Drift guards.** Several suites mirror expressions that live in production
files and check that the original still says what the mirror assumes:
`backend/tests/msgvis.py` re-implements the client's ghost-graduation rule and
greps four sources for the nine expressions it ports, `derived.test.ts` pins
seven `convo.ts` constants, and the authority suite audits every
grant-mutating site in `ledger.py`. If one of those fires, the runner says so
under its own banner and separately from the pass/fail count,
because a drift failure does not mean the app is broken — it means a guarded
expression moved and the test's model of it did not, so every check downstream
of that model has quietly become fiction until the mirror is updated. The
summary also reports guards that ran and *held*, and flags a guard that
printed no verdict at all.

**CI** runs on `ubuntu-latest`. `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the fast tier on every push and pull request; the
job is blocking, so a failing suite fails the build. `.github/workflows/full-tests.yml` runs the full tier nightly and
on demand (`workflow_dispatch`).

The ledger (`backend/orgtree/ledger.py`) is the single source of truth for
credits, authority, addressing, and capability subsets; the supervisor
(`supervisor.py`) owns sessions and turns; `api.py` is a thin FastAPI + WS
layer; the canvas lives in `frontend/src/canvas/` (shared · modals · mail ·
desk · cards · OrgCanvas) behind the `Canvas.tsx` barrel — the frontend is
TypeScript throughout.
