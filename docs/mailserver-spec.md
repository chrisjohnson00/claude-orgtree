# orgtree mailserver — a public hub for org-to-org mail across machines

> ⚠︎ **Historical design record (F-06).** The local file-queue bridge it compares against was RETIRED on 2026-08-05: `@ext:` is gone and independent chats are first-class hub clients with their own `@net:` addresses. The reasoning below is kept as written — read the precedent paragraphs as history, not as instructions.

Author: session 4f69f83a · 2026-08-04 · drafted from a source audit of the existing
external-mail path. Every line citation below was read, not recalled.

Status: **exploration only.** Not built, not scheduled.

---

## 0. The one-paragraph version

A separate subproject — a small HTTPS service you run once, centrally — that lets orgtree
instances on different computers mail each other. Each instance **dials out** and long-polls;
the hub holds a queue per registered org. To an agent, a remote org looks exactly like a
local one: a single recipient address, mail in, one reply out. The orgtree side of this is
**small**, because every inbound path already funnels through one function and every outbound
path through one dispatch point. The hub is the new work, and the interesting problems are not
transport — they are **identity, spend, and what happens to mail that arrived while you were
asleep**.

---

## 1. Start here: outbound-only is the whole reason this design is sound

Each instance opens an outbound HTTPS connection to the hub and holds it. Nothing listens on
the user's machine. That means:

- **No port forwarding, no router config, works behind NAT and CGNAT.** A laptop on hotel wifi
  participates the same as a desktop.
- **No `--expose-admin`.** D-39 added that flag deliberately as command-line-only *because
  exposing the admin port is dangerous*. This design never asks the user to do that. The
  contrast is worth stating plainly: peer-to-peer between orgtree instances would require
  every participant to expose a port; a hub requires none of them to.
- **The attack surface is the hub, and the hub holds no credentials to anything.** It cannot
  run tools, spend credits, or read a workspace. Worst case it lies about mail.

☞ Design consequence: resist any later feature that needs the hub to *reach into* an instance.
The direction of the connection is the security model.

---

## 2. Where it grafts on — the existing machinery

The org-inbox model already exists and already has three outside-party namespaces. This adds a
fourth, and almost nothing else.

| namespace | who | transport today |
|---|---|---|
| ~~`@ext:<chat>`~~ | a Claude Code session on this machine | **RETIRED 2026-08-05** (was a local file queue) — sessions are hub clients now, addressed `@net:` |
| `@org:<slug>` | another org **in this instance** | direct call (`supervisor.py:2465`) |
| `@mcp:<peer>` | an outside session polling us | the peer pulls (`externtool.py`) |
| **`@net:<slug>`** | **an org on another machine** | **the hub — new** |

**Inbound is one funnel.** Every outside message — chatq or inter-org — reaches the ledger
through `deliver_org_inbox(slug, peer, body, attachments)` (`supervisor.py:2415`): it copies
attachments into each recipient's `uploads/`, calls `post_external_mail` (`ledger.py:903`),
then drives each recipient with the coordinate-and-speak-for-the-org framing. A hub client is
therefore *a poll loop that calls that function* — structurally the same shape as
`start_chatq_bridge`, which is 35 lines.

**Outbound is one dispatch.** `agent_call` (`api.py:1869`) inspects what the ledger accepted
and routes it: `ext_send` for `@ext:`, `org_send` for `@org:`, nothing for `@mcp:`
(`api.py:1929-1948`, `2087-2100`). `@net:` is one more branch. The ledger's authorization
branch (`ledger.py:800-826`) already covers a new prefix by adding it to one tuple — the rules
that only top-level agents or org-inbox audience holders speak for the org, and that kiosks are
sealed, come along for free.

**Estimated orgtree-side surface: a poll/spool thread, one ledger prefix, one dispatch branch,
one settings block, one status pill.** The hub is the actual project.

---

## 3. Identity — self-issued secret at org creation (user ruling, 2026-08-04)

> instead of orgs receiving a secret on join, they just generate their own secret on creation and
> supply that as their registration info. still include the username and org name in the slug, but
> also part of the secret for uniqueness, and the rest can be used for authentication like a
> password kind of.

**Ruled: the secret is minted by the org at creation, not issued by the hub.** This is better than
the hub-issued TOFU scheme it replaces, for three reasons worth writing down:

- **The identity exists before any hub does**, so the same org can join several hubs under one
  address, and an org that never joins one still has an identity waiting.
- **It survives a move.** The earlier draft warned that baking the OS username into the address
  meant an org relocated to another PC lost its identity and its correspondence history. With a
  self-issued secret it does not: copy the org, keep the address.
- **No land grab is possible**, which removes the TOFU mechanism entirely rather than securing it.

### The one change I would make: derive the public part, don't slice it

The proposal splits one generated secret into a public piece (in the slug) and a private piece
(the password). That works, but it makes the security depend on a split being done correctly
forever — and it publishes a substring of the credential in every roster listing, log line, and
agent prompt. Hash instead:

```
secret        = secrets.token_hex(16)            # 128 bits — the repo's existing credential
                                                 # pattern (api.py:352,549,554,587)
fingerprint   = sha256(secret).hexdigest()       # stored by the hub
slug          = f"{org}.{username}.{fingerprint[:6]}"
```

Identical to the user's scheme from the outside — `research.ncola_k8bx.a3f9c1` — and the visible
suffix still comes *from* the secret, so it still supplies the uniqueness. What changes:

1. **The public part discloses nothing about the private part**, even in principle, so there is no
   split to get wrong and no "how many characters is safe to show" question to answer.
2. **The hub stores no secrets at all — only the fingerprint.** Registration presents the secret;
   the hub hashes it and compares. A hub database leak therefore exposes no credential, which for
   a service the user is being asked to run on a public box is a meaningful difference.
3. **Impersonation is impossible rather than merely refused.** Claiming someone's address requires
   producing a secret that hashes to their fingerprint. There is nothing to race and nothing for
   the hub to arbitrate.

⚠ Compare against the **full** stored fingerprint, never the 6-character display suffix — 24 bits
is brute-forceable in seconds. The suffix is a label; the fingerprint is the check. Use
`hmac.compare_digest`.

### The details that follow from it

- **Generate with `secrets`, never `uuid4` or `random`.** The repo already draws this distinction
  in practice: `uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]` for entity ids, `secrets.token_hex(16)` for credentials
  (kiosk token, sandbox secret). This is a credential.
- ☞ **The secret must never enter an agent's context.** An org's mail identity in the prompt of an
  agent that reads untrusted remote mail is an exfiltration path straight to impersonation. It
  belongs beside the kiosk token — in the org doc, returned only over the loopback admin listener
  (`api.py:481-483` already documents exactly this care for the kiosk token), and excluded from
  every agent-facing payload.
- **Send it in a header over TLS, never in a URL** (URLs land in access logs and in the browser
  history of anyone opening the hub UI), and never log it.
- **Backup is now the user's problem, and that is the trade.** Nobody can restore a lost secret —
  that is the property that makes it trustworthy. So the UI must show it once at creation, offer an
  export, and say plainly that losing it loses the address. A "regenerate" button that silently
  mints a new identity would be a data-loss trap; call it what it is.
- **Rotation is OUT of v1** (user ruling 2026-08-04: simplify now, harden later). A leaked secret
  is handled by recreating the org. ⚠ When it is added, the trap is that the display suffix stops
  matching the current secret — see the immutability section below. Precedent for the re-mint
  button exists on the kiosk token (`api.py:968`).
- **Upgrade path, if it is ever wanted:** sign each request with the secret (HMAC) instead of
  sending it. The secret then leaves the machine exactly once, at registration, and the same key
  material gives the end-to-end message signing floated in §7.

### What the username is now for

With uniqueness coming from the fingerprint, the username no longer carries any load — it is
human-readable decoration, which is the right job for it. One residual point: it is still
**asserted, not verified**, so a peer may register `payroll.ceo.a3f9c1` and look official. Since
nothing authenticates on it, this is a social-engineering surface only, and the mitigations are
cheap: always render the fingerprint suffix alongside the name in the roster, and keep the
receiving agent's framing at "untrusted outside party" regardless of how the sender is labelled
(§7).

### The slug is immutable for the org's lifetime (user ruling, 2026-08-04)

> the full slug should remain identical for the lifetime of the org it represents.

All three parts — org name, username, fingerprint suffix — are fixed at first registration and never
change. This closes the rotation question: **the suffix is pinned, not re-derived.**

Consequences that must be built in, not assumed:

- ☞ **Store the network slug; never recompute it.** If it is derived from name + username at call
  time, then moving the org to another machine or renaming the OS account silently changes the
  address. Mint once, persist in the org doc, read it thereafter. (Locally this is already the
  shape: an org's slug is set at creation, `ledger.py:301`, and there is no rename path.)
- **With no rotation in v1, `sha256(secret)[:6] == suffix` always holds** — one less thing to get
  wrong, which is the point of dropping rotation. ⚠ That equality is exactly what stops holding the
  day rotation lands: the suffix is then an artifact of the *first* secret, and verification must
  compare the hub's **stored fingerprint** rather than re-derive the suffix, or every org is locked
  out of its own address the first time it rotates. Do not build a check that assumes the equality.
- **The username part may become misleading** — an org moved to a different account keeps `.bob` in
  its address. That is cosmetic; nothing authenticates on it (§3), and stability is worth more than
  accuracy here.

### Joining: no gate (user ruling, 2026-08-04)

> any new org that has access can join and is immediately listed, the join auth is just having
> access to the server (it will be on a closed network)

**Ruled: reachability is the authorization.** No join code, no admission step, no operator
approval — an org that can reach the hub registers and appears in the roster immediately. Drop the
join-code idea from the earlier draft.

☞ **This does not make §3 redundant, and the distinction is worth stating because it is easy to
collapse.** "No join auth" governs *may you register*; the org secret governs *are you the holder
of this address*. Without the second, any participant on the closed network could poll another
org's queue and read its mail, or send as it — not through malice necessarily, but a
misconfigured or copied instance would do it by accident. So: **joining is open, addresses are
owned.** The self-issued secret stays exactly as specified.

⚠ The security posture now rests entirely on the network boundary, which makes that boundary
load-critical. Two consequences: the hub must not be reachable from outside it (bind to the private
interface, and if a tunnel is ever added, that decision reopens this ruling), and TLS is still
worth having inside it — not against outsiders, but because the org secret crosses the wire on
every call and a closed network is not a private one.

### Same-machine auto-connect (user question, 2026-08-04)

> if an org is running adjacent to a mailserver on the same computer, can it auto-connect to it by
> default?

**Yes, and the repo already has this exact pattern — copy it rather than invent one.** chatq
registration is automatic and unconfigured: `chatq_available()` checks whether chatq is present
(`supervisor.py:2336`), and if it is, every org registers at **startup** (`api.py:342`) and at
**creation** (`api.py:540`). The hub client should behave identically against a hub on the default
local address.

It works because §3 already removed everything that would need a prompt: the org mints its own
secret at creation, and joining needs no gate. There is nothing to ask the user, so asking would be
ceremony.

Four constraints, three of which the chatq precedent already encodes:

- **Kiosk orgs are excluded**, and a stale registration from before a seal is torn down —
  `chatq_register_org` already does exactly this (`supervisor.py:2348-2351`). Same rule, same
  reason.
- **The opt-out is a checkbox in the creation form's mailserver section** (user ruling,
  2026-08-04), sitting with the hub-address fields: *“connect to the mailserver on this computer”*,
  **checked by default**. Being listed means peers can mail the org and thereby spend its credits,
  so it must be visible and refusable at the moment the org is made — not buried in settings
  afterwards.
  - Home: the **`advanced`** disclosure of the create form (`App.tsx:583-584`), where kiosk and
    sandbox already live since D-40, below folder selection. The collapsed summary line
    (`App.tsx:577`) should gain the hub state the same way it names `kiosk`/`sandboxed`.
  - ⚠ **Do not gate the checkbox on the hub being detected.** The boot race is real (below): a hub
    that is not up yet must still be checkable, or the setting is unavailable exactly when an
    autostarting machine is being configured. Show detection as a *hint* beside the box —
    “detected at `<addr>`” or “not running right now; will connect when it starts” — and let the
    checkbox stand on its own.
  - Remote hubs are separate address entries in the same section, typed in explicitly (a local hub
    is the only thing that auto-connects).
- ⚠ **Auto-connect applies to the LOCAL hub only.** A remote hub is configured explicitly. Under
  the closed-network ruling reachability is the authorization, so an instance that auto-joined
  every hub it could reach would be joining networks by accident.
- ⚠ **Retry; do not probe once.** With §9's autostart, the hub container and orgtree race at boot,
  and the hub will frequently lose. A single startup probe would leave the instance
  permanently unregistered until someone restarted it — treat "no hub yet" as an ordinary state of
  the poll loop, not an error, and keep retrying. This is the one place the chatq precedent does
  not help: chatq is a file on disk that is either there or not, whereas a container takes time to
  come up.

---

## 4. Transport — long poll, with a spool the current code does not have

**The long-poll shape already exists in-repo and works.** `extern_wait` (`api.py:1618`) plus the
client loop in `externtool.py:167-177`: bounded slices (25 s), a cursor (`after`), an empty
return on timeout, the client immediately re-waits. Copy it — including the cursor, which is
what makes "nothing is ever delivered twice" true.

**Recommended: one connection per instance, not per org.** The naive reading of "orgs connect to
the hub" gives eight held connections for eight orgs. Multiplex: the instance authenticates once
and polls for *all* its registered orgs, and the hub returns `{org, from, body, id, sent_at}`
rows. Fewer sockets, one place to show connection status, and the roster arrives in the same
response.

**Delivery must be at-least-once with acks.** The hub holds a message until the client
acknowledges the id; the client acks *after* `deliver_org_inbox` has persisted it. Duplicates on
a crash are acceptable and already precedented — `reconcile`'s journal fold-back explicitly
prefers "a duplicate delivery, never a loss" (`supervisor.py:2656-2658`). Add an id-seen set so
duplicates collapse rather than double-drive.

⚠ **Outbound needs a local spool, which today's code has no equivalent of.** Right now a failed
outbound send appends a *warning to the agent's tool result* (`api.py:2093`) while the ledger has
already logged the message as sent (`ledger.py:822`) — the org's own record says "out" for
something that never left. On a LAN-free hub that will happen routinely (hub restart, laptop
suspend, wifi drop). So:

- The agent's `orgtree_message` to `@net:` must **return instantly** by writing to a local spool.
  Do not make an agent's tool call wait on a network round trip; `/api/agent` is a sync route
  (`api.py:1870`) so it holds a threadpool worker for the duration.
- A background sender drains the spool with backoff and updates a per-message status.
- The org inbox's outbound entry gets a state — `queued → sent → delivered` — instead of the
  current unconditional "out". This also gives the sender's UI something honest to show.

---

## 5. The user's question — mail that arrived while the instance was down

> do we activate the org immediately automatically? does the org wait for the user to manually
> trigger it to check?

**orgtree already answers this for local mail, and the answer is "activate automatically".**
`reconcile()` does a drain-on-start pass: any live, unfrozen node with a waiting mailbox is
simply driven again (`supervisor.py:2671-2678`), on the stated principle that *messages ARE
mail* — undelivered mail lives in the org doc, so there is no shadow queue to replay.

Two measured facts make auto-activation cheaper than it sounds:

- **A backlog collapses into one turn.** `_envelope` calls `take_mail(nid)`, which drains the
  *entire* mailbox into a single prelude (`supervisor.py:861-887`). Forty messages from five
  peers wake an agent **once**, with all forty in front of it — not forty times.
- **Frozen and archived orgs already decline safely.** `send_message` returns without running
  anything for a frozen node, and mail stays boxed until the org-wide resume
  (`supervisor.py:1735-1745`).

So the default should match the existing invariant: **deliver always, drive automatically.**
Diverging would create precisely the class of bug this codebase keeps fighting — state that
exists but is not acted on until someone happens to look.

But three things genuinely differ from the crash-window case, and they justify a guard:

1. **Offline duration is unbounded.** A crash gap is seconds; a hub gap can be a fortnight. A
   two-week-old "can you review this today?" should not be answered as if it just arrived.
2. **The sender has moved on.** Remote peers are other people's agents, running on other
   people's schedules.
3. **Every wake spends real money**, and the user may not be at the machine when the instance
   boots.

### Ruled: auto-start (user, 2026-08-04) — v1 ships `auto` ONLY

The three positions below are the design space; the user ruled **`auto` only for v1**. `notify` and
`curated` stay documented because they are the natural knobs if auto-start ever proves too eager,
but nothing else in the spec depends on them existing.


> and i agree with the auto start as well, i was also leaning in that direction


A per-org setting, `net_wake`:

| value | behaviour |
|---|---|
| **`auto`** *(default)* | Exactly `reconcile`'s existing semantics: mail lands, recipients are driven, one turn per agent for the whole backlog. |
| `notify` | Mail lands in the org inbox and the org shows unread on the tree; **nothing is driven** until the user releases it (one click, drives the same coalesced batch). Nothing is lost, nothing is spent. |
| `curated` | First contact from an **unknown** peer goes to the **user's** inbox as a notice; known peers behave as `auto`. This is the anti-spend-drain position and pairs with §7. |

Three rules that hold under all three positions:

- ☞ **Never gate *delivery* on the policy — only *driving*.** The message is persisted the moment
  it arrives, in every mode. This is the same rule the docket keeps rediscovering (§②a: a repair
  mechanism must never be gated on the data it repairs); here it reads as *a message must never
  be conditional on the org being awake*.
- **Stamp staleness in the envelope.** `[arrived while this org was offline · sent 3 days ago]`
  gives the agent the one fact it needs to decide whether acting is still useful. Cheap: the hub
  already knows `sent_at`, and the envelope formatter is one function (`_mail_block`,
  `supervisor.py:890`).
- **Cap the wake.** If the backlog exceeds N messages or M peers, drive once with a summary and
  let the agent pull the rest — a boot should not be able to consume an org's whole day's credit
  before the user sees the screen.

---

## 6. Presence — the thing that makes a collective actually work

> work autonomously as a collective unit

Without presence, an agent mails an offline peer, gets nothing, and either waits or gives up
wrongly. The hub knows exactly who is connected, so publish it:

- `orgtree_list_orgs` (`mcptool.py:199`) already lists reachable `@org:` peers. Extend the rows
  with remote peers plus `online: true|false` and `last_seen`.
- A reply-latency expectation matters more than raw online/offline: "this peer was last
  connected 4 days ago" tells an agent to route around rather than block.
- The eye's settings panel gets a status pill — connected / last sync / N queued outbound — so
  the *user* can see it too.

---

## 7. The part that will bite: inbound mail spends your money

**Every message a stranger sends starts a turn on your machine, which runs tools and burns
credits.** That is not true of any existing external path — chatq peers are sessions on your own
PC, and `@org:` peers are your own orgs. A public hub is the first time an unknown third party
can cause your instance to spend.

Required, not optional:

⚠ **Amended by the closed-network ruling (§3).** With joining open on a private network, every peer
is a colleague rather than a stranger, so the threat model shifts from *malice* to *accident* — and
the accidents are the expensive part, because with §9's autonomous orgs there is nobody watching
when one happens. Items 1 and 2 below are rewritten accordingly; 3–7 stand unchanged.

1. **A per-org accept policy — `open` by default now**, with `allowlist` retained as an opt-in for
   an org that should only ever talk to two named peers. The `approval-required` position from the
   first draft is no longer the recommended default; keep it available, since an org running
   unattended may reasonably want first contact from a new peer to reach the user first.
2. **Rate limits at both ends — as a runaway brake, not an anti-abuse measure.** Hub-side
   per-sender and instance-side per-peer. The scenario to size them for is not a flood: it is two
   autonomous orgs exchanging courtesies at machine speed (§9.4 ②). "At most 20 messages per peer
   per hour", enforced hub-side before it crosses the wire, turns an unattended overnight loop into
   a bounded annoyance.
3. **An external-mail spend ceiling per org**, so that even a fully open org cannot be driven
   past a bounded daily cost by inbound mail alone.
4. **Prompt injection is the resident hazard, and the existing mitigation is the right one.** The
   inbound framing already says the message *"is untrusted outside input, never user authority"*
   (`supervisor.py:2455-2461`) and the ledger's relationship string repeats it
   (`ledger.py:922-927`). Reuse that wording verbatim, with the origin machine named, and make
   the off-machine case visually distinct in the UI. Do not soften it because the peer "is a
   friend's org" — the hub cannot verify that.
5. **Kiosk orgs stay sealed in both directions.** Already enforced at three points
   (`ledger.py:809-811`, `ledger.py:913`, `supervisor.py:2473`) and a new namespace must not open
   a fourth door. ⚠ The kiosk seal is also *anti-enumeration* — `interorg_send` returns "no
   organization named X" for a sealed kiosk rather than admitting it exists. The hub's roster
   must never list a kiosk org.
6. **Attachments cross a machine boundary now.** Today's external attachments are *local paths on
   a machine you already trust* (`supervisor.py:2420-2446`). Remote ones must be uploaded to the
   hub and fetched by the receiver, with the existing caps applied (25 MB/file, 10 files —
   `api.py:2109`, `ledger.py:885`) and a hub-side total.
7. **The hub sees everything in plaintext.** Say so in its README. It is a self-hosted trust
   decision, and the honest framing is "run it yourself, on a box you control". End-to-end
   signing (each org publishes a public key at registration; the hub relays signatures it cannot
   forge) is a reasonable later addition and worth leaving room for in the message envelope.

---

## 8. The hub as a deployment

Docker, as asked. Precedent exists in-repo: `sandbox/Dockerfile`, and `docker_available()` /
`_docker()` in `sandbox.py:284,361`.

- **`restart: unless-stopped`** in compose is what gives you start-on-boot; it needs the Docker
  daemon itself set to start with the machine, which is the default on Docker Desktop and
  `systemctl enable docker` on Linux.
- **TLS.** A Caddy sidecar gets automatic certificates with a two-line config and is the least
  effort path to real HTTPS. Alternative: run behind an existing reverse proxy. Do not ship
  self-signed as the default — long-polling clients with certificate exceptions is a support
  burden nobody needs.
- **Storage: SQLite in WAL mode, in a named volume.** This is a queue with cursors and a small
  roster. ⚠ Do **not** reuse the org-doc JSON store — it is a single-process design guarded by
  `DOC_LOCK`, and the hub is a multi-writer network service. Different concurrency profile,
  different tool.
- **Retention.** Undelivered mail expires (30 days is a sane default) and the hub says so at
  registration. Otherwise a laptop that never comes back accrues forever.
- **`/healthz`**, structured logs, and a metrics line — the operator is going to be one of the
  users, debugging at a distance.
- **Its own UI**, as the user specified: a mimic of the org mail panel, plus a roster with
  presence, plus per-org queue depth. It should be read-mostly; the hub is not a place to compose
  from, or it becomes a fourth authority nobody audits. The `docs/ui-guide.md` conventions apply
  if it should feel like the same product.

---

## 9. Unattended operation — orgtree must survive a reboot, and more than that

> this opens up the possibility of orgs running fully autonomously without direct oversight by a
> user, so we need a way of ensuring orgtree starts up automatically with the pc it's on

Boot-start is the easy half. The hard half is that **three separate things quietly break when
nobody is logged in and nobody is watching**, and two of them are measured on this machine below.

⚠ **Terminology — the two words are about different things.** An earlier draft of this spec talked
about "an unattended org that is not headless", which is incoherent; the correction is worth
keeping because the distinction it was reaching for is real:

- **Unattended** describes the **machine**: it autostarts, survives a reboot, and runs with nobody
  sitting at it (§9.1-§9.3).
- **Headless** describes the **org**: no user will *ever* answer it, so user-bound requests are
  auto-denied (§9.6).

The middle case is a machine that runs unattended while the user checks in daily — the org's
requests are not denied, merely *slow*, and subscription auth is fine because a visiting user can
re-login. So the axis is **how long until a human answers**, not presence: headless is that
interval being infinite. An org is headless because it was set headless, never because its host
happens to be unattended.

### 9.1 ⚠ Do not install it as a Windows service

`~/.claude/.credentials.json` — measured on this machine, 566 bytes, mode `-rw-r--r--` — is a
**plain file in the user profile**. A Windows service running as `LocalSystem` (or any "run whether
the user is logged on or not" Task Scheduler entry that does not load the profile) resolves a
*different* `~`, finds no credentials, and every agent turn fails at the CLI. The failure is
delayed and confusing: orgtree itself boots fine, the UI serves, the tree renders, and only the
turns die.

**The correct Windows recipe is Task Scheduler at logon, running as the user**, with the box set to
auto-login. Specifically: trigger *At log on* (that user), action = the deploy script's launch line,
"Run only when user is logged on", **untick "Stop the task if it runs longer than…"** (the default
3-day limit will kill an unattended backend, silently, on day three), and set *If the task fails,
restart every 1 minute*.

☞ **Docker Desktop forces the same conclusion independently.** Measured here: `com.docker.service`
exists but is `Stopped` / `StartType: Manual` — that service is only the privileged helper. The
engine lives behind the Docker Desktop app, which is a **user-session application**. So an
instance hosting *sandboxed* orgs cannot work from a logged-out box at all, service or not: it
needs a real interactive session (auto-login, and Docker Desktop set to start on login). An
instance with no sandboxed orgs is free of this.

### 9.2 ⚠ The hard ceiling on "fully autonomous": authentication expires

Measured from the same credentials file:

| field | value |
|---|---|
| `claudeAiOauth.expiresAt` | **~8 hours** out |
| `claudeAiOauth.refreshTokenExpiresAt` | **2026-08-19** — ~15 days from issue |

The 8-hour access token is refreshed by the CLI and is not a concern while the machine is running.
The **refresh token is the ceiling**: it has a finite life, and when it lapses, re-authentication is
*interactive*. An unattended org therefore has a bounded autonomous lifetime measured in weeks, not
forever — and the way it ends is silent, at whatever hour it happens, with every turn failing.

⚠ What I measured is the schema and the two timestamps. Whether the CLI rolls the refresh token
forward on each refresh — which would extend the ceiling indefinitely for a box that stays online —
I did **not** verify, and it should be tested before anyone promises unattended operation. The
recommendation holds either way, because it is cheap:

**Watch both timestamps and alarm early.** The instance should read the credentials file, and when
`refreshTokenExpiresAt` is inside a few days, mail the user and post a notice. Discovering an auth
lapse from a pile of failed turns at 3am is the worst possible way to find out, and this is a file
read and a comparison. It is also the one piece of this that is worth building *before* the
mailserver, because it applies to any unattended orgtree.

### 9.3 Boot-start is not crash-restart

A boot trigger covers the reboot; it does nothing for the backend dying at 04:00. Both are needed.
One systemd **user** unit (`systemctl --user enable --now orgtree`, plus `loginctl enable-linger
<user>` so it runs without a login session) with `Restart=always` and `RestartSec=10` covers both.

⚠ Whatever launches it must not fight a manually-run instance. `update.sh` already has the
stale-backend guard and a `listeners()` port check (D-42, D-47) — the autostart entry should reuse
the same script rather than invoke Python directly, so that logic is not duplicated into a second
place. Note also how `update.sh` detaches (a redirected subshell, the shape that keeps a piped
invocation from hanging) — an autostart wrapper that re-implements detachment will reintroduce that
bug.

### 9.4 What must be true of the *org*, not just the process

Autostart makes the process survive. These make the org survive:

1. **`auto_resume` on.** It already exists — usage-limit-frozen agents restart on their own one
   minute after the reported reset (`supervisor.py:2527`). For an unattended org it stops being a
   convenience and becomes close to mandatory; without it a limit at midnight parks the org until a
   human presses ▶.
2. ☞ **A loop breaker. This is the biggest unattended risk, and it is not hypothetical.** D-44 in
   this very docket is *"subordinates keep talking in a loop as the coordinator goes back and forth
   with them"* — fixed by a charter clause, and noticed because **the user was watching**. Two
   autonomous orgs on separate machines, each politely acknowledging the other's status update,
   reproduce that failure with nobody in the room and a credit meter running on both. Needed: a
   per-peer exchange-depth counter that refuses to auto-drive past N consecutive round trips
   without new content, and the coordinator charter clause extended to remote peers.
3. **A daily inbound-drive budget per org**, so the total cost of *being mailed* is bounded even
   when every sender is friendly. On a closed network the realistic threat is not malice but a
   runaway loop (②) — and a cap is the same defence against both.
4. **A dead-man's switch.** If an unattended org's spend crosses a threshold, or it has been
   running N days without a human opening the UI, it should stop and mail the user rather than
   continue on its own recognisance. Autonomy the user cannot audit after the fact is the thing to
   avoid; a bounded run they can review is not.
5. **Log rotation and disk.** An instance running for months writes transcripts and event logs
   forever. Nothing caps that growth, sandboxed or not.

### 9.5 Credential mode — an API key instead of the user's subscription

> we may need an alternative mode of operation for autonomous orgtree instances to allow them to
> use an API key instead of taking the user's subscription credentials.

**Three credential modes already exist — but only for sandboxed orgs.** `sandbox.py:451-455,499-503`
selects between them per org:

| mode | how | source |
|---|---|---|
| `proxied` *(default)* | container gets `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` → the bridge; the **host** attaches the OAuth token (`subproxy.py`), so the sandbox never holds a credential | host `~/.claude/.credentials.json` |
| subscription | the credentials file is **copied into** the container home (`sandbox.py:472`) | same |
| **API key** | `-e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=<key>` straight into the container | `kiosk.api_key` (creation form / dashboard) **or** `ORGTREE_SANDBOX_API_KEY` |

So the mechanism, the settings field, and the escape-hatch env var are all present. What is missing
is the case autonomy actually needs:

1. **Unsandboxed orgs have no per-org credential at all.** `clean_env()` (`supervisor.py:406`)
   hands the CLI the whole host environment minus `CLAUDE_CODE_*`, so a host-level
   `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` would reach *every* org or none — untested, and not per-org. The fix is
   small and the seam already exists: the per-node env is built three lines above the spawn
   (`supervisor.py:1178-1181`), which is where an org's key belongs.
2. **The selector is keyed off `kiosk.api_key`** — an org must be a kiosk to have a key. Autonomy
   wants it on the ordinary org settings block (`api.py:751`), promoted out of the kiosk spec.
3. ⚠ **The bridge proxy would override a key if a sandboxed org ever used both.** `anthropic_proxy`
   strips `x-api-key` and force-sets `Authorization: Bearer <subscription token>`
   (`api.py:1835-1841`). Correct today, since proxy mode and key mode are mutually exclusive — but
   the exclusivity is implicit in `use_proxy` and should be made explicit before anyone adds a
   third caller.

**Why this matters for autonomy specifically, beyond preference:** an API key removes §9.2's
ceiling entirely. No 15-day refresh window, no interactive re-auth, no shared credential file that
a headless box must keep alive. It also isolates blast radius — an unattended org burning its own
key does not consume the user's subscription rate limits, and the key can be revoked without
touching the user's login. ☞ **For a genuinely unattended instance, API-key mode should be the
default, not the alternative.**

The trade to state plainly: an API key is metered spend against the org's own budget, so the
ledger's credit accounting becomes the *only* brake — which raises the priority of §9.4's daily
inbound-drive budget and dead-man's switch from prudent to necessary.

**Correction to §9.2 from reading `subproxy.py`:** the refresh token **does** roll forward — the
client stores `res.get("refresh_token", <old>)` on every refresh (`subproxy.py:74`). So a box that
stays online plausibly renews indefinitely and the 15-day figure is a floor, not a ceiling. Still
unverified: whether the token endpoint actually returns a new refresh token each time. ⚠ Separate
real defect found in passing — `subproxy` never updates `refreshTokenExpiresAt` when it writes a new
refresh token, so that field goes stale, and the §9.2 watcher must not trust it without a fix.

### 9.6 `headless` — an org that knows nobody is watching

> we should also have a setting that runs an org in "headless" mode: orgs are made aware that the
> user is not present, all user-bound queries (such as increased credit requests) are instantly
> denied, and all communication is expected to arrive via org mail.

Three parts, in the order they matter.

**① Tell the agents.** A line in the system framing — *no user is present; nothing you send to the
user will be read; every request to the user is auto-denied; your only correspondents are your own
chain and the org inbox.* Without this an agent asks, gets refused, and retries, which is the
expensive failure. `orgtree_status(blocked, …)` should be explicitly named as the right move for
"I cannot proceed", since a human will read it later even if none reads it now.

**② Auto-deny the user-bound verbs.** Deny at the ledger, not in the UI, so it is uniform across
the MCP tools and the API. The full set of user-bound paths — every place the ledger currently
escalates to a human — is seven:

| path | headless behaviour |
|---|---|
| `request_credits` (`ledger.py:2353`) | **deny immediately**, with the reason in the result so the agent adapts rather than retries |
| `request_audience` → user (`ledger.py:1046`) | **deny immediately** |
| `post_mail` to `USER` (`ledger.py:827-841`) | ⚠ see below — deny is the wrong answer |
| unrouteable inbound mail rescue (`ledger.py:939`) | keep: it is a record, not a question |
| permission-ceiling notice (`ledger.py:240`) | keep |
| audience-granted notice (`ledger.py:1122`) | keep |
| Fable filter / weekly-limit decisions (`ledger.py:2461,2530`) | keep — and see ④ |

☞ **Do not silently deny mail to the user.** The user inbox is also the audit trail of an
unattended run, and it is where §9.4's dead-man's switch reports. Correct behaviour: accept the
write, tell the sender *"stored; no user is present and no reply is coming"*. Denying it destroys
the only record of what an unsupervised org thought was worth escalating.

**③ Make it observable.** The org shows a headless badge, and turning it off should surface
everything that accumulated while nobody was there — denied requests included, since a pile of
them is the signal that the org's grant is set wrong.

**④ Decide what happens on a hard stop.** Two existing policies escalate to the user and then
*wait*: `fable_limit_policy` and `fable_filter_policy`, both defaulting to `halt` (`api.py:772`).
A halted headless org is a dead org nobody will notice. Either force `auto_resume` on in headless
mode (it already exists, `supervisor.py:2527`) or require a non-`halt` policy, and say which at the
setting.

**⑤ Headless REQUIRES an API key (user ruling, 2026-08-04).** Not a recommendation — a hard
constraint, enforced at org creation and in settings: turning headless on without a key is refused,
and clearing the key while headless is on is refused. The derivation is §9.2: subscription auth
ends in an **interactive** re-login, and a headless org is defined as one with nobody to perform
it. Subscription + headless is therefore a configuration whose only possible ending is silent
death at an unpredictable hour. An API key has no such ceiling.

Two supporting reasons, both real but secondary to that one: the org's spend stops competing with
the user's own subscription limits, and a key can be revoked without touching the user's login.

**Composition:** headless is orthogonal to *sandboxed*, incompatible with *kiosk* (below), and
now **coupled to §9.5**. Note the second-order effect: an org that cannot ask for more credit needs
a grant sized for the whole unattended run up front, and metered API spend makes overrunning it a
bounded cost rather than a surprise — which is why §9.4's daily cap and dead-man's switch are
listed as necessary rather than prudent.

⚠ **Do not conflate headless with kiosk.** A kiosk is sealed from the outside world
(`ledger.py:809-811,913`); headless is the opposite — it *depends* on the outside world, because
org mail is its only channel. An org that is both is an org that cannot communicate at all.

## 10. Inbox scoping and read receipts (user, 2026-08-04)

> an orgs inbox should only show mail directed to it. also for this cross server boundary we
> probably want read receipts.

### 10.1 Scoping — two different surfaces, two different answers

⚠ **Corrected 2026-08-04** — an earlier draft of this section made the hub UI per-org. It is not.

**The hub UI is global.** It shows all traffic across every registered org, with a **filter to
narrow to one org**. That is the operator's view of the network, and it is deliberate: on a closed
collaborative network the person running the hub is a participant, not an adversary.

**The org's own inbox is scoped** — an org sees only mail directed to it. That is what the poll
returns, and it is a functional property before it is a security one: an instance fetches its own
queue by its own address. No cross-org read is offered to an *instance*; the global view lives in
the hub UI only.

Inside an org nothing changes: inbound mail still reaches every live top-level agent and every
org-inbox audience holder (`ledger.py:969`).

☞ Consequence to keep in mind for §7 №7 — the hub UI being global means hub access is effectively
read access to everyone's correspondence. That is fine under the closed-network ruling and is the
cost of the operator view; it just means "who can reach the hub UI" is the same question as "who
can read all the mail".

### 10.2 Two receipts: received (the hub has it) and read (an agent consumed it)

> read receipts and received receipts (for server connectivity confirmation)

They answer different questions and fail independently, so they are separate signals, not two
points on one bar:

- **Received** — the hub acknowledged custody. Answers *is my connection to the server working*.
  Its absence means the network or the hub, never the peer.
- **Read** — an agent's turn actually consumed the message. Answers *did anyone act on this*. Its
  absence with a received receipt present means the peer is down, frozen, or idle.

⚠ **A missing received receipt does not mean the message was not delivered.** A send that times out
may already have been accepted. The retry must therefore be **idempotent on the message id** —
otherwise every flaky connection produces duplicate mail at the far end, which under §9.4 is a
re-send loop with no human to notice it. The id already has to exist for the ack cursor; reuse it.

**No received receipt within a threshold ⇒ the instance marks the hub unreachable** and says so in
the status pill (§6), rather than silently spooling forever. The poll connection doubles as the
liveness beacon, so this is one signal serving both directions.

Most systems can only say a message was fetched. Here the delivery journal already knows when an
agent **actually received** it: `_journal_drain` writes a token when mail is drained into a turn
envelope, and `_confirm_delivered` (`supervisor.py:1250`) fires only once the CLI emits a real event
afterwards — the same machinery whose unconfirmed batches get folded back on restart
(`supervisor.py:2654-2668`). That is a true read signal, not a transport ack.

**Five states, each with an existing owner** — `received` and `read` are the two the user named;
the rest are the intermediate positions they bracket:

| state | set when | source |
|---|---|---|
| `queued` | the sender's spool holds it (§4) | sender instance |
| **`received`** | the hub acknowledged custody — the connectivity signal | hub |
| `fetched` | the recipient instance pulled and acked it | recipient instance |
| `delivered` | it landed in the recipient's org inbox | `post_external_mail` |
| **`read`** | an agent's turn actually consumed it | `_confirm_delivered` |

Design notes:

- **Receipts ride the existing long poll** — piggyback on the next poll or ack call. No second
  connection, no callback, nothing new to keep alive.
- **They complete the sender's view**, which today is a quiet lie: a failed outbound send appends a
  warning to the agent's tool result while the ledger has already logged the message as sent
  (`api.py:2093`, `ledger.py:822`). §4's spool gives it a real status; receipts give it the far end.
- ☞ **Surface `read` to the sending agent, because it changes behaviour.** "Delivered but unread
  for six hours" is the signal that a peer is down or busy, and it is what stops an agent from
  re-sending — which matters most under §9.4, where a re-send loop between two unattended orgs is
  the expensive failure.
- **`fetched` without `read` is the diagnostic that matters**: mail arrived, no agent has consumed
  it. That means the recipient is frozen, out of credits, or has no live top-level agent. Worth
  rendering distinctly rather than collapsing into "delivered".
- ⚠ **Receipts leak activity.** They tell a peer when your org is running and when its agents woke.
  On the closed collaborative network this is ruled for, that is acceptable and useful — but it is
  a real disclosure, so if the hub ever leaves that network the receipt policy needs revisiting
  alongside §3's boundary assumption.
- **Never let a receipt fail a send.** A receipt that cannot be delivered is dropped; correspondence
  must not depend on the back-channel.

## 11. Further suggestions

Ordered by value-per-effort.

1. **Group addresses / broadcasts — RULED OUT of v1** (user, 2026-08-04): "for now we won't
   concern ourselves with broadcasts/mailing lists. just the basic org to org chat that the
   existing mailbox system offers." Kept here only so the idea is not rediscovered as new. A
   hub-side fan-out remains the cheap way to do it later.
2. **Threading — reserve the field, build the UI later.** Org-inbox mail is flat today, and with
   ten peers holding concurrent conversations agents will conflate them. But threading is beyond
   "the basic org to org chat the existing mailbox system offers", so v1 does not render it. ☞ Carry
   an optional `thread_id` in the message envelope from day one anyway: it costs nothing unused and
   cannot be retrofitted into mail already stored without it.
3. **A directory blurb per org.** Each registered org publishes one line of "what we do" — the
   material already exists in `org.md`. Without it, an agent choosing a recipient is guessing
   from a slug.
4. **Delivery status in the sender's view.** Falls out of §4's spool for free, and fixes today's
   quiet lie where a failed send is still logged as out.
5. **Hub receipt time is the ordering authority.** Instance clocks differ, and the ledger sorts
   ISO strings lexically (`ledger.py:119-120` records a previous ordering bug). Stamp both
   `sent_at` (claimed) and `received_at` (hub), sort by the latter, display the former.
6. **Put the hub config in the global org defaults** (`api.py:777`, `defaults.json`) so it is
   entered once rather than per org. Per-org settings then only decide *whether to join* and the
   accept policy.
7. **A test hub, not a mock.** The pattern that has repeatedly worked here is a real end-to-end
   probe. Two orgtree instances on one machine, different ports and data roots, against a hub in
   a container, is a genuine two-machine test and catches the cursor, ack, and duplicate bugs
   that a mock never will.
8. **Deliberately not suggested: routing the *user's* mail through the hub.** Keep the user's
   inbox local. The moment a remote party can write to it, "the user said so" — the top of the
   authority model — becomes a network-reachable claim.

## 12. Open questions — for the user, not for me to assume

### ✓ Closed by user ruling, 2026-08-04

| decision | ruling |
|---|---|
| identity | **self-issued secret** minted at org creation; public slug suffix derived from it (§3) |
| pending mail on start | **auto** (§5) |
| joining | **open** — reachability is the authorization, on a closed network (§3) |
| default accept policy | **`open`**, following from the above (§7) |
| who builds it | **the implementer**, not this session |
| join a hub after creation | **yes** — configurable at creation *and* later; §12 №1 is closed |
| scale | **10+ participants** — see the consequence below |
| hub host | **Linux** (§8, §9.3) |
| `net_wake` positions | **`auto` only** for v1; `notify`/`curated` are not built |
| scope | **strictly org-to-org** — the hub does not relay `@ext:`/`@mcp:` |
| slug lifetime | **immutable** — all three parts fixed at first registration (§3) |
| receipts | **received** (hub custody / connectivity) **and read** (an agent consumed it) (§10.2) |
| hub mail UI | **global** — all orgs' traffic, with a per-org filter (§10.1) |
| broadcasts / mailing lists | **out of v1** — basic org-to-org chat only (§11 №1) |
| secret rotation | **out of v1** — simplify now, harden later (§3) |
| headless + credentials | **API key REQUIRED** — headless without one is refused (§9.6) |
| number of hubs | **one for v1**, several not designed out (§12) |
| same-machine hub | **auto-connect by default**, local hub only; opt-out is a **checkbox in the creation form's mailserver section** (§3) |

⚠ **10+ participants, with v1 deliberately kept basic.** The simplification ruling keeps threading
and broadcasts out, so the one thing that must still happen at day one is **reserving an optional
`thread_id` in the envelope** (§11 №2) — unused it costs nothing, and it cannot be retrofitted into
mail already stored without it. The **directory blurb** (§11 №3) stays a suggestion but earns its
place at ten peers: nobody addresses ten orgs correctly from slugs alone. Rate limits should be
sized for ten peers × the §9.4 loop breaker, not for two.

### Still open

**Nothing blocking.** One residual curiosity, which no decision waits on: whether the OAuth token
endpoint returns a fresh refresh token on every refresh (the client already stores one if it does —
`subproxy.py:74`). It only affects how long a *subscription* org survives on a box nobody visits,
and §9.6 already removes that combination for headless orgs.

### One hub for v1 — but do not design several out (user ruling, 2026-08-04)

> for now we will expect to use just one hub, but that doesn't mean several might not be possible
> in the future

v1 connects to exactly one. The cost of keeping the door open is three schema decisions taken now,
none of which add work to a single-hub build:

- **Store hub config as a list of one**, not a scalar. Retrofitting a scalar into a list means
  migrating every org doc that has one.
- **Key per-hub state by hub id** — registration status, last-seen, spool entries, and receipts all
  belong to *a* hub, not to *the* hub. This is the one that is genuinely painful later, because it
  is a shape change in stored data rather than a config change.
- **Do not make the remote address imply a hub.** `@net:<slug>` is deliberately hub-agnostic:
  §3's self-issued identity means one secret already works everywhere, so an org's address is the
  same on every hub it joins. Resolution (which hub reaches this peer) is a lookup, not a parse.

Everything else — the UI, the settings block, the status pill — can stay singular until there is a
second hub to show.

---

## 13. Roster lifetime — who may say an org is gone (2026-09-04)

**THE RULE, and every rejected alternative fails it the same way: only the
holder of an identity's secret can prove an org is gone, and it now says so at
delete time. For everything else the only sound rule is the hub's own —
silence for N days — because silence is a fact the hub measures itself rather
than an inference about someone else's machine.**

What was wrong: `POST /api/unregister` existed from 2026-08-06 with **no
caller in the orgtree backend**. `hubtool.unregister_identity` gave a chat
identity the verb; an org had none. So a deleted org kept its roster row until
the hub's own prune, and the compose picker offered it as a recipient that can
never receive anything. Measured on the live hub 2026-09-04: 135 rows, 132
with no local org of that base slug, 3 online.

Three mechanisms now cover it, and they are deliberately different in kind:

1. **`DELETE /api/orgs/{slug}` takes the polite exit** (`net.unregister_org`),
   snapshotting the doc first because the identity secret is needed before
   `delete_org` renames it away. It can never fail a delete; a 401 is success;
   the local identity survives, so a restore returns with the same address.
2. **The hub prunes rows silent for `ORG_RETENTION_DAYS`** (default 45,
   `HUB_ORG_RETENTION_DAYS`), skipping any row that still holds queued mail.
   Measured 2026-09-04: it had never fired — 101 rows seen within 7 days, 34
   within 7–30, none older than 30. The roster was never permanent; it was
   45-day *lagged*, and the lag existed because deletion never said goodbye.
3. **The compose picker folds peers silent for 7 days** behind a disclosure
   and states every offline peer's age. It deletes nothing, so the user stops
   *seeing* dead recipients within a week regardless of when rows actually die.

Retention is policy and the honest lever if 45 days ever feels long; do not go
below ~14 days — a laptop on holiday would drop out of everyone's picker, a
cost borne by a machine that did nothing wrong. It re-registers automatically
on the next 401, so the cost is a lag, not a loss.

### Rejected rules, and why each one is the same mistake

| candidate | why not |
|---|---|
| "no local org with this base slug" | a fact about the OBSERVER. A row whose org lives on another install pointed at the same hub is not dead, it is remote |
| "the name looks like a probe (`zz *`)" | a naming convention is not a fact, and it dies the day someone names a real org that way |
| "never seen online" | `online` is a 90-second presence window; almost everything is offline at any instant |
| repeated base slug, fresh fingerprint | the only candidate with real signal — 24 rows of one probe org — and still rejected: a re-mint is indistinguishable from a rebuilt data volume, and "I cannot tell which" is the correct place to stop. Removing the SOURCE (delete now unregisters) is the better fix |

### The one thing still missing — a proposal, not a task

**A hub-side, operator-authenticated "forget this row" in the hub's own web
UI is the only place a human can safely make the call for a row whose secret
is gone.** Once an org is deleted its secret goes with it, so no orgtree
install can ever unregister that row again; the hub operator is the only party
with standing to decide, and the hub is the only process that can authenticate
them. Deliberately NOT built (coordinator ruling 2026-09-04): the three
mechanisms above already stop the population growing, expire what is left, and
hide it from the user within a week, so a fourth mechanism would be bought to
accelerate a set that is already shrinking. Build it only if a row ever needs
to die faster than the sweep for a reason none of the three cover.
