/** The nodes ▶ resume will ACTUALLY act on — the banner's count, its title

 *
 *  user report 2026-08-26: the banner read "resume 2 · 2 agents frozen" in an
 *  org whose two frozen agents had since been RETIRED. Retiring does not clear
 *  the freeze record — deliberately, since a retired agent keeps its context
 *  and can be rehired — so the old test (`n.frozen != null` alone) counted
 *  nodes ▶ has never been willing to touch. Nothing behind the banner was
 *  broken: the backend already refused them and ▶ resumed nobody.
 *
 *  ⚠ THE RULE IS NOT HERE, AND MUST NOT COME BACK HERE. `node.resumable` is
 *  composed by the backend from `supervisor.resumable`, which is the single
 *  expression of it. The first fix re-derived the rule in this file and held
 *  the two copies together with a test that read `supervisor.py` as text —
 *  and a source-text check cannot tell a rule that got STRONGER from one that
 *  got weaker, fires on a harmless rename, and misses a semantic change that
 *  keeps the same spelling. If you find yourself adding a condition below,
 *  the condition belongs in `_resumable` instead.
 *
 *  The `frozen != null` test is a TYPE NARROWING, not a second copy of the
 *  rule: `resumable` is only ever true for a node carrying a record, and the
 *  banner dereferences `.frozen.until` — this is how TypeScript is told. */
