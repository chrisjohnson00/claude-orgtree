// canvas/modalpin.tsx — PINNING A MODAL TO THE WINDOW (user spec 2026-09-06):
// "most openable modals in the app should be able to be pinned to the window
// and dragged around, like pinned agent windows. this goes for inboxes,
// usage, presentations, the docket, etc."
//
// ⚠ THE WHOLE DESIGN IS ONE RULE: THE DOM SHAPE NEVER CHANGES. Every modal in
// this app is the same two boxes — a full-screen `.overlay` and a `.settings`
// panel centred in it. Pinning does NOT rebuild that; it re-dresses it. The
// same two elements, in the same positions, with the same children in the same
// order, take different classes and an inline rect. React therefore never
// unmounts the panel's subtree, and the surface's scroll position, its open
// row, its half-typed reply and its in-flight fetches all survive a pin, an
// unpin, a drag and a resize without any of the modals knowing this file
// exists. A wrapper that nested the children one level deeper when pinned
// would remount them and lose all of that — it would look identical in a
// screenshot and be wrong.
//
// TWO SPACES, AGAIN (see pins.tsx's header for the agent-window pair). Agent
// windows live in VIEWPORT px, as children of `.viewport`, because they detach
// from a canvas that pans and zooms under them. A pinned modal lives in WINDOW
// px: `.overlay` is `position: fixed; inset: 0`, so an absolutely positioned
// child of it is already in window coordinates and nothing has to convert.
// That is also literally what the user asked for — "pinned to the window".
//
// STACKING. Centred modals are z-index 20. A pinned modal must stay usable
// while another surface opens over it (Astra 2026-09-06), so pinned windows
// take a band ABOVE them, 21–29, hard-clamped exactly like the agent band. The
// folder picker (60), the lightbox (95) and toasts (100) stay on top of
// everything, unchanged.
//
// What persists (localStorage `orgtree-modal-pins`): a map of kind → {rect,z}.
// A kind IS the pin — present means pinned, absent means centred — so the
// pinned state survives closing and reopening the surface, the way an agent's
// pinned window survives a reload. Geometry is NOT per-org: `usage` and
// `settings` are the same window whatever org is loaded, and the per-org
// surfaces (docket, gallery, inboxes) are one-at-a-time by construction.
//
// NOT DONE HERE, deliberately: edge/peer snapping (pinSnap.tsx is written
// against a set of sibling agent rects and a viewport, and a modal window has
// no peers to align to), and the minimise ghost (a modal has no card to fly
// home to — unpinning re-centres it in place instead).

/**
 * A modal opened from INSIDE a pinned window — compose from the org inbox, a
 * confirmation from the lineage panel. Two things must be true of it, and
 * neither is true of a plain nested overlay:
 *
 * 1. IT MUST NOT BE TRAPPED IN ITS HOST'S STACKING CONTEXT. A DOM descendant
 *    of a pinned panel paints inside that panel's z band whatever its own
 *    z-index says, so its backdrop covers its own host — MEASURED in Edge:
 *    with the org inbox pinned, `elementFromPoint` over the inbox's own title
 *    bar returns the compose backdrop, and the window's drag handle and close
 *    button are unreachable. The same shape from the other side, measured by
 *    codex-delivery on the lineage panel's confirmation: a second pinned
 *    window above the host paints over the dialog. A portal to document.body
 *    takes the dialog out of the band entirely and fixes both.
 *
 * 2. THE PARENT MUST BE CONSTANT. document.body in BOTH modes, never "inline
 *    when centred, portaled when pinned" — moving a subtree between parents
 *    remounts it, and that would throw away a half-typed compose draft on
 *    every pin toggle (Astra 2026-09-06: no lost draft on pin/unpin).
 *
 * Centred, the dialog sits at MODAL_OVER_PINS_Z, ABOVE the whole pinned band:
 * a dialog raised from a pinned window that rendered BEHIND that window would
 * be the same defect with its sign flipped. Pinned, the frame's own inline
 * z-index wins over that rule and the dialog joins the band like any other
 * window.
 *
 * The wrapper swallows pointerdown for the same reason `MaybePortal` does: a
 * React portal still bubbles events through the REACT tree, so without this a
 * press inside the dialog would also reach the host panel's handler and raise
 * the HOST above the dialog it just opened.
