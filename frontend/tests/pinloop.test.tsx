// pinloop.test.tsx — the ↑-you chip must not change the predicate that shows it.
//
// React #185 report, 2026-08-30: DeskChat's layout effect calculated whether a
// user row was above the scrollport, then mounted a sticky chip IN FRONT of
// that row. At the boundary, that extra in-flow height moved the row on-screen;
// the next layout effect removed the chip; then the row moved above again.
// Layout effects run before paint, so the UI never settled and React stopped it
// after 50 nested commits.
//
// jsdom has no layout. This fixture therefore supplies the measured geometry
// explicitly: the row sits at bottom 0 without the chip and bottom 5 with it;
// the chip itself is 5px high. That is the real feedback shape in its smallest
// form. A test that merely sees no error has no witness — this one makes the
// old predicate alternate every commit and asserts the fixed predicate keeps
// the target stable after the chip has entered flow.
