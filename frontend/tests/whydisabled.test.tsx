// wcc848de4 — a disabled control must say WHY it is disabled.
//
// The three sites here were found by `frontend/audit_disabled.py` and then
// confirmed by reading: of 72 disabled controls in the app, most are fine —
// the gate is a transient `busy`, or an empty field the user is looking at,
// or the reason is already printed next to the control. These are the ones
// where a dead button explains nothing.
//
// ⚠ WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR, AND WHY IT MOUNTS REAL COMPONENTS. A pure test of
// `stepDownWhy`/`stepUpWhy` proves the sentences are right and NOTHING about
// whether any button asks for them — delete both `title=` attributes and a
// helper-only file stays green. So every site is mounted from its own real
// component and read out of the DOM, and each check has its live-control
// counterpart: a title that appears on an ENABLED control is its own defect
// (a tooltip explaining a limit the user has not hit), so "absent when
// enabled" is asserted everywhere too.
//
// Run: cd frontend && node tests/run.mjs whydisabled
