# -- 1c - the store pre-flight, and the automatic upgrade off JSON ----------
# USER RULING 2026-09-04 (17:00Z and 17:02Z): SQLite is orgtree's canonical
# format, JSON is DEPRECATED AND PAST LTS, and an existing JSON install must be
# migrated AUTOMATICALLY the moment it updates -- no prompt, no flag, nothing
# for the operator to know or type.
#
# THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES. main defaults to ORGTREE_STORE=sqlite. An install
# still on the JSON format that pulls main gets a backend that REFUSES to start
# (MigrationRefused) against its own data root, and a routine `git pull` becomes
# an outage.
#
# ⚠⚠ WHY IT IS *HERE*: the question is about THE CODE THIS RUN IS ABOUT TO
# DEPLOY. An old install's store.py still defaults to `json`, so a check placed
# BEFORE the pull reads "JSON code, JSON root -- all fine" and does nothing, on
# exactly the population it exists for. After the pull, before the build, and a
# very long way before the stop.
#
# The upgrade itself runs inline: tools/cutover.py, in the window this script
# already opens between stopping the backend and starting it. That is section

orgtree: THIS INSTALL HAS NO ROLLBACK ROUTE.

Written $(date -u '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC') by update.sh.

WHAT HAPPENED
  Your data root was migrated to SQLite successfully, but the step AFTER
  it -- export-verify -- exited $EXP_RC. At least one org did not survive a
  round trip out of SQLite, so no validated export was written.

WHAT THAT MEANS
  Your data is here and the install is running normally. What is missing is
  the way BACK. tools/cutover.py rollback rebuilds the JSON documents from
  exports/, and there is no complete set of those. The <slug>.json.premigration
  files beside your databases are NOT a rollback: they predate every write
  since the migration.

HOW TO FIX IT -- worth doing now, not later
  Stop the backend, then re-run the export:
      $PY $CUT export-verify "$DATA_ROOT"
  If it succeeds, exports/ holds your route back and this file is removed
  automatically by the next deploy. If it fails again, read what it names --
  it says which org and why.

Deleting this file changes nothing except your ability to find out.
